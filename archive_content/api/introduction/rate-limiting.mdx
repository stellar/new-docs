title: Rate Limiting
order: 40

Horizon rate limits on a per-IP-address basis. By default, a client is limited to 3600 requests per hour - one request per second on average.

When a client exceeds this limit, Horizon will return a `429 Too Many Requests` error.

While streaming, each update of the stream counts as a request and against a clientâ€™s allotted rate limit.
