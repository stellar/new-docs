The `transaction_failed` error returns a [`400` error code](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/400) and occurs when a client submits a transaction that was well-formed but was not included in the ledger due to some other failure.

For example, a transaction may fail if:
1. The source account for transaction cannot pay the minimum fee.
2. The sequence number is incorrect.
3. Tne of the contained operations has failed such as a payment operation that overdraws on the paying account.

In almost every case, this error indicates that the transaction submitted in the initial request will never succeed. There is one exception: a transaction that fails with the `tx_bad_seq` result code (as expressed in the `result_code` field of the error) may become valid in the future if the sequence number it used was too high.
