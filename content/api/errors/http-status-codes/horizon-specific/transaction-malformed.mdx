The `transaction_malformed` error returns a [`400` error code](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/400) and occurs when a client submits a malformed transaction. 

There are many ways in which a transaction could be malformed, including:
1. You submitted an empty string.
2. Your base64-encoded string is invalid.
3. Your [XDR](../../../introduction/xdr.mdx) structure is invalid.
4. You have leftover bytes in your [XDR](../../../introduction/xdr.mdx) structure.
