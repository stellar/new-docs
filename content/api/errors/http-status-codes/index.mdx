Some errors only occur at the Horizon level and are not thrown in Stellar Core. These are usually issues with how the transaction was formed or a conflict between the transactionâ€™s composition and how the Horizon server is setup.

Stellar uses conventional HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of an API request. In general:

- Codes in the 2xx range indicate success.
- Codes in the 4xx range indicate an error that failed given the information provided
- Codes in the 5xx range indicate an error with the Horizon server.

There are two types of Status Codes: [Standard Status Codes](./standard.mdx) and [Horizon-Specific Status Codes](./horizon-specific/index.mdx).
