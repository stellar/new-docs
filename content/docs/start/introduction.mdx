Stellar is designed to make it easy for developers to issue digital assets and build applications that take advantage of a public distributed ledger.  The goal of these docs is to explain key concepts and offer practical examples so developers can roll up their sleeves .  Ideally, you can use them to guide your project from conception to production.

Like the Stellar codebase, these docs are open source and constantly evolving, so if you can't find what you're looking for or have ideas for improvements, please contribute by filing a Github issue or pull request in this repository. 

This section outlines some of the basic conetps and channels for developers, so if you're already familiar with Stellar, you may want to skip to sections detailing whateer interestes you.  You can use the left-side menu of the docs to navigate to various sections, and the right-side menu to navigate to different sections on a given page.  For a quick summary of each section, please visit the [Welcome page](./index.mdx)

## Background Reading
If you're new to Stellar, you may want to start by getting a high-level understanding of what Stellar is and.  A great place to do that is the Learn section of stellar.org.  :

* Intro to Stellar (https://www.stellar.org/learn/intro-to-stellar) explains what Stellar is for, how it works, and who builds on it and why.

* [The Power of Stellar](https://www.stellar.org/learn/the-power-of-stellar) delves into some of the fundamental things you can do with Stellar including issuing digital assets, trading peer-to-peer, and transforming currency as you send it.
