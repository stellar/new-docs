## The Public Network and the Test Network

Fundamentally, Stellar is a collection Stellar Core nodes, which are computers that keep a common ledger of accounts and balances, listen for incoming transactions, and, using the Stellar Consensus Protocol, agree to apply a valid set of those transactions to update the ledger.  Each transaction applied to the ledger incurs a small fee — which is necessary to prevent bad actors from spamming the network — and the ledger is generally updated every 3-5 seconds.  

There are actually two different versions of the Stellar network: one for testing and one for real-world deployments.  



To help you test your tools and applications, Stellar.org operates a small test network and Horizon instance. [Get started with the testnet.](link)

## Stellar SDKs
Most Stellar developers work with a Stellar SDK to create their code and handle network queries and transaction submissions.  There are several SDKs listed in the [SDK section of the docs], and they're all robust, and have their own documentation showing you how to request data and create and submit transactions.  When you start developing on Stellar, the first step is usually to find the SDK in your language of choice, and to familiarize yourself with how it works.

## API: Horizon
Most applications interact with the Stellar network through [Horizon](link), a RESTful HTTP API server. Horizon gives you a straightforward way to submit transactions, check accounts, and subscribe to events. Because it’s HTTP, you can communicate with Horizon using an SDK, your web browser, or simple command line tools like cURL.

At the moment, Horizon handles most queries — independence from Stellar Core — and submits transactions to the network by interacting with Stellar Core.

## Network Backbone: Stellar Core
Behind the scenes, every Horizon server connects to [Stellar Core](link), the backbone of the Stellar network. The Stellar Core software does the hard work of validating and agreeing with other instances of Core on the status of every transaction through the [Stellar Consensus Protocol](link) (SCP). The Stellar network itself is a collection of connected Stellar Cores run by various individuals and entities around the world. 

Stellar Core is the backbone of the network, but most developers never touch it directly.  Instead, they use SDKs that talk to Stellar Core via Horizon.  

## Specs for Building on Stellar: Stellar Ecosystem Proposals
In addition to Stellar infrastructure, many Stellar-based projects also require outside infrastructure, and the guidelines for building it are described in Stellar Ecosystem Proposals.  You can read about SEPs here.  

One example of how SEPs work: when anchor services accept deposits and honor withdrawals of fiat currencies, they set up servers that interact with wallets to authenticate users, gather customer information necessary for compliance, and link it to Stellar accounts.  We have a whole section of these docs — Enable Deposits and Withdrawals — that explains how to set up those servers following relevant SEPS.
