The relationship between anchor servers and wallets can be complicated with money and KYCs passing back and forth. In order to bring that all-important level of interoperability, wallets should look to implementing SEP-0024 which provides a sane collection of endpoints for interacting with ecosystem anchors.

One of blockchains biggest problems is interoperability. Both in connecting old existing infrastructure with this new updated infrastructure as well as interoperating within this new ecosystem connecting all the different platforms and networks. The Stellar way of solving these problems is through anchored assets, or stablecoins, accessed via SEP-0024. Put simply SEP-0024 is the Stellar Ecosystem Proposal which outlines the method for depositing non Stellar ecosystem assets into Stellar and withdrawing those assets again to their native platform.

For example SEP-0024 is the process by which you get your Bank of America, grocery buying dollars, tokenized and available at a 1:1 rate onto the Stellar network for use in the Stellar decentralized exchange and inversely get them back into your Bank of America account.

It would also allow for the deposit and withdraw of other crypto currencies like BTC, ETH or even ERC20 tokens like USDT. If the financial landscape were all a bunch of lakes, SEP-0024 would the rivers by which you move your currency canoe in and out of the Stellar lake.
