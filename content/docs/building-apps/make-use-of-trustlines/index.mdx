XLM payments are great, and you can accomplish quite a lot just utilizing Stellar's native asset but the fun really begins once you enable custom assets in your wallet.

Stellar custom assets exist on the network in the form of trustlines. Strictly speaking there are no "assets" other than XLM, and even XLM is just an asset which every account natively trusts. This is an important distinction when it comes to how we think and interact with custom assets on Stellar. To enable or "create" a new asset we create trust between an issuer of the new asset and at least one other account. For example as account A if I want to issue MYCOIN to the world I must get other accounts, like account B, to trust MYCOIN from my account A.
