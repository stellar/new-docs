Horizon is responsible for providing an HTTP API to data in the Stellar network. It ingests and re-serves the data produced by the Stellar network in a form that is easier to consume by the average application relative to the performance-oriented data representations used by Stellar Core.

This guide describes how to administer a production Horizon 2.0+ instance (you can refer to the [Developers' Blog](https://www.stellar.org/developers-blog/a-new-sun-on-the-horizon) for some background on the performance and architectural improvements of this major version bump). For information about developing on the Horizon codebase, check out the [Development Guide](https://github.com/stellar/go/blob/master/services/horizon/internal/docs/developing.md).

Before we begin, it's worth reiterating the sentiment echoed in the [Run a Core Node](../run-core-node) guide: **we do not endorse running Horizon backed by a standalone Stellar Core instance**, and especially not by a *validating* Stellar Core. These are two separate concerns, and decoupling them is important for both reliability and performance. Horizon instead manages its own, pared-down version of Stellar Core optimized for its own subset of needs (we'll refer to this as a "Captive Core" instance).


## Upgrading From Horizon 1.x
If you're coming from an existing deployment of Horizon, you're probably running it alongside a standalone "Watcher" Stellar Core node. As noted above, this architecture is now **deprecated**, and support for it will be dropped in Horizon 3.x. The [Upgrading](./upgrading.mdx) guide should facilitate the process to moving to the Captive Core architecture and get you up to speed.


## Why Run Horizon?

You don't need to run your own Horizon instance to build on Stellar: the Stellar Development Foundation runs two Horizon servers, one for the public network and one for the test network: https://horizon.stellar.org and https://horizon-testnet.stellar.org. These servers are free for anyone to use and should be fine for development and small-scale projects. They are, however, rate limited, and we don't recommended using them for production services that need strong reliability.

Running Horizon within your own infrastructure provides a number of benefits. You can:

  - Disable request rate limiting for guaranteed network access
  - Have full operational control without dependency on the Stellar Development Foundation
  - Run multiple instances for redundancy and scalability
