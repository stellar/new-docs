Horizon is responsible for providing an HTTP API to data in the Stellar network. It ingests and re-serves the data produced by the Stellar network in a form that is easier to consume than the performance-oriented data representations used by Stellar-Core.

This guide describes how to administer a **production** Horizon instance, catered towards the 2.0+ release, which introduced massive performance and architectural improvements (you can refer to the [Developers' Blog](https://www.stellar.org/developers-blog/a-new-sun-on-the-horizon) for some history). If you are just starting with Horizon and want to deploy it quickly to test it out, consider the [Quickstart Guide](./quickstart) instead. For information about developing on the Horizon codebase, check out the [Development Guide](https://github.com/stellar/go/blob/master/services/horizon/internal/docs/developing.md).

Before we begin, it's worth reiterate the sentiment echoed in the [Run a Core Node](../run-core-node) guide: **we do not endorse running Horizon backed by a standalone Stellar-Core instance**, and especially not by a *validating* Stellar-Core. These are two separate concerns, and decoupling them is important for both reliability and performance. Horizon instead manages its own, pared-down version of Stellar-Core optimized for its own subset of needs (we'll refer to this as a "Captive Core" instance).


## Why Run Horizon?

You don't need to run your own Horizon instance to build on Stellar: the Stellar Development Foundation runs two Horizon servers, one for the public network and one for the test network: https://horizon.stellar.org and https://horizon-testnet.stellar.org. These servers are free for anyone to use and should be fine for development and small-scale projects. They are, however, rate limited, and we don't recommended using them for production services that need strong reliability.

Running Horizon within your own infrastructure provides a number of benefits. You can:

  - Disable request rate limiting for guaranteed network access
  - Have full operational control without dependency on the Stellar Development Foundation
  - Run multiple instances for redundancy and scalability
