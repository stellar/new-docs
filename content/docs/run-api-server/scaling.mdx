title: Scaling
order: 70
---

As alluded to in the discussion on [Prerequisites](./prerequisites.mdx), Horizon encompasses different logical tiers that can be scaled independently for high throughput, isolation, and high availability. The following components can be independently scaled:

  - Web service API (serving)
  - Captive Core (ingestion and transaction submission)
  - Database (storage)

As always, scaling encompasses a spectrum. A few common scaling architectures follow.


## Single VM

As a starting point, for development purposes or low load environments with limited history retention (e.g. a few ledger entries), a single VM would suffice.

## Low to Medium Load 

For low to medium load environments with up to 30-90 days of data history retention and modest API request traffic, this configuration isolates the database instance from the API service and ingestion process.

### Extension: Isolating Captive Core

Additionally, Captive Core can be further isolated into its own VM, especially for isolating high throughput historical catch-up with parallel workers, leaving it unaffected by API request servicing load.

## Enterprise *n*-Tier

This architecture services high request and data processing throughput with isolation and redundancy for each component. Scale the API service horizontally by adding a load balancer in front of multiple API service instances, each only limited by the database I/O limit. If necessary, use ALB routing to direct specific endpoints to specific request-serving instances, which are tied to a specific, dedicated DB. Now, if an intense endpoint gets clobbered, all other endpoints are unaffected.

Database instances can be scaled when the I/O limit is reached by using read-only replicated copies that stay in sync and a read/write instance connected to Captive Core. Each DB replica can support a set of request servers to support additional horizontal scaling. 

Additionally, a second Captive Core instance shares ingestion load and serves as a backup in case of an instance failure.

### Extension: Redundant Hot Backup

The entire architecture can be replicated to a second cluster. The backup cluster can be upgraded independently or fail-overed to with no downtime. Additionally, capacity can be doubled in an emergency if needed.
