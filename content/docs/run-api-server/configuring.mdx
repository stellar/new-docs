Once Horizon is [installed](./installing.mdx), you are ready to configure it. Note that Horizon fulfills three important, distinct roles: **serving requests** like a regular web-based API, **ingesting ledgers** from the Stellar network to keep its world-view up to date, and **transaction submission** for interacting with the Stellar network. Though we encourage operators to separate these responsibilities across instances for resilience and independent scaling, a single Horizon instance can perform all of these functions at once.

For the remainder of this guide, we will assume that you want a single, standalone Horizon instance that performs ingestion and allows transaction submission.


## Parameters

Horizon can be configured by both command line flags or environment variables. To see Horizon's list of command line flags that are available, their default values, and their corresponding environmental variables, run:

<CodeExample>

```bash
stellar-horizon --help
```

</CodeExample>

When you run the command above, you'll see that Horizon defines a large number of flags; however, only a handful are required to get started:

| flag | envvar | example |
| ---- | ------ | ------- |
| `--db-url` | `DATABASE_URL` | postgres://localhost/horizon_testnet |
| `--history-archive-urls` | `HISTORY_ARCHIVE_URLS` | `https://history.stellar.org/prd/core-testnet/core_testnet_001,https://history.stellar.org/prd/core-testnet/core_testnet_002` |

  - The most important parameter, `--db-url`, specifies the Horizon database; its value should be a valid [PostgreSQL Connection URI](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.6/static/libpq-connect.html#AEN46025).
  - The other parameter, `--history-archive-urls`, specifies a set of comma-separated locations from which Horizon should download [history archives](../run-core-node/publishing-history-archives.mdx).

#### With Ingestion
As outlined at the beginning, we presume you are interested in starting an ingesting instance. For this, you need to specify some additional flags:

| flag | envvar | example |
| ---- | ------ | ------- |
| `--ingest` | `INGEST` | true |
| `--captive-core-config-path` | `CAPTIVE_CORE_CONFIG_PATH` | /etc/default/stellar-captive-core.toml |
| `--stellar-core-binary-path` | `STELLAR_CORE_BINARY_PATH` | /usr/bin/stellar-core |

  - The first parameter, `--ingest`, enables the ingestion subservice.
  - The second parameter, `--captive-core-config-path`, points to a Captive Core configuration file. This TOML file only requires a few fields (explained [below](#configuring-captive-core)) to get up and running.
  - The final parameter, `--stellar-core-binary-path`, is a filesystem path to a Stellar Core binary. Horizon will actually search your PATH for `stellar-core` by default, so if your environment is configured appropriately, you won't even need to pass this.

#### Without Ingestion
If you aren't configuring your Horizon instance to perform ingestion, it still needs awareness about what's going on in the Stellar network to be useful. Thus, you need to point Horizon to a running Stellar Core instance:

| flag | envvar | example |
| ---- | ------ | ------- |
| `--stellar-core-url` | `STELLAR_CORE_URL` | http://127.0.0.1:12626 |

This can be a [Remote Captive Core](./remote-core.mdx) instance with its underlying Core node exposed or a [standalone](../run-core-node/) Stellar-Core instance.

### Manual Installation

Specifying command line flags every time you invoke Horizon can be cumbersome, so we recommend using environment variables. There are many tools you can use to manage them, such as [direnv](http://direnv.net/) or [dotenv](https://github.com/bkeepers/dotenv).

For configuration related to [Captive Core](#configuring-captive-core), you can store parameters in a separate TOML file and pass it to the ``--captive-core-config-path`/`CAPTIVE_CORE_CONFIG_PATH` argument.

### Package Manager Installation

If you installed Horizon [via your package manager](./installing.mdx#package-manager), the provided `stellar-horizon-cmd` wrapper will import a configuration from `/etc/default/stellar-horizon` and set up the environment accordingly. Hence, if you want to change things, edit the configuration file in `/etc/default/stellar-horizon`.

<Alert>

This script invokes Horizon with the `stellar` user, so make sure that permissions for this user are set up accordingly. For example: the `--captive-core-storage-path` (by default the current working directory) should be writable for this user; the user should be able to execute the `horizon` and `stellar-core` binaries; etc.

</Alert>

Note that the default configuration (located at `/etc/default/stellar-horizon`) provided by the package manager will **enable ingestion by default** (`INGEST=true`). Refer to the later [Ingesting Transactions](./running.mdx#ingesting-transactions) section to see what setup is right for you. If you want certain nodes dedicated exclusively to fulfilling requests, you should drop this flag accordingly.


## Preparing the Database

Before running the Horizon server, you must first prepare the Horizon database specified by the `DATABASE_URL`. This database will be used for all of the information produced by Horizon, most notably historical information about transactions that have occurred on the Stellar network.

To prepare a database for Horizon's use, you must first ensure it is blank. It's easiest to create a new database on your PostgreSQL server specifically for Horizon's use (e.g. `createdb horizon`). Note that you may need to [add a role](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.6/sql-createrole.html) for yourself through the `postgres` user if you're starting from scratch. Next, install the schema by running `stellar-horizon db init`. This command will log any errors that occur.

Remember to update the appropriate command line flags or environment variables to configure Horizon as explained [above](#parameters).

### Postgres Configuration

It is recommended to set `random_page_cost=1` in Postgres' configuration if you are using SSD storage. With this setting, Query Planner will make a better use of indices, especially for `JOIN` queries. We've noticed a huge speed improvement for some queries with this setting.

To improve availability of both ingestion and frontend servers it's recommended to set the following values:

  * `tcp_keepalives_idle`: 10 seconds
  * `tcp_keepalives_interval`: 1 second
  * `tcp_keepalives_count`: 5

With the config above, if there are no queries from a given client for 10 seconds, Postgres should start sending TCP keepalive packets. It will retry 5 times every second. If there is no response from the client after that time it will drop the connection.


## Configuring Captive Core

While a full Stellar Core node requires a complex configuration with [lots of possible fields](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-core/blob/master/docs/stellar-core_example.cfg), the Captive Core configuration file can be kept extremely barebones. The rest of the configuration will be generated automagically at runtime. Here's is a minimal working example, operating under the assumption that you want to connect to the testnet and trust SDF's validators exclusively:

<CodeExample>

```toml
[[HOME_DOMAINS]]
HOME_DOMAIN="testnet.stellar.org"
QUALITY="HIGH"

[[VALIDATORS]]
NAME="sdf_testnet_1"
HOME_DOMAIN="testnet.stellar.org"
PUBLIC_KEY="GDKXE2OZMJIPOSLNA6N6F2BVCI3O777I2OOC4BV7VOYUEHYX7RTRYA7Y"
ADDRESS="core-testnet1.stellar.org"
HISTORY="curl -sf http://history.stellar.org/prd/core-testnet/core_testnet_001/{0} -o {1}"

[[VALIDATORS]]
NAME="sdf_testnet_2"
HOME_DOMAIN="testnet.stellar.org"
PUBLIC_KEY="GCUCJTIYXSOXKBSNFGNFWW5MUQ54HKRPGJUTQFJ5RQXZXNOLNXYDHRAP"
ADDRESS="core-testnet2.stellar.org"
HISTORY="curl -sf http://history.stellar.org/prd/core-testnet/core_testnet_002/{0} -o {1}"

[[VALIDATORS]]
NAME="sdf_testnet_3"
HOME_DOMAIN="testnet.stellar.org"
PUBLIC_KEY="GC2V2EFSXN6SQTWVYA5EPJPBWWIMSD2XQNKUOHGEKB535AQE2I6IXV2Z"
ADDRESS="core-testnet3.stellar.org"
HISTORY="curl -sf http://history.stellar.org/prd/core-testnet/core_testnet_003/{0} -o {1}"
```

</CodeExample>

_(For the remainder of this guide, we'll assume this file lives at `/etc/default/stellar-captive-core.toml`.)_

The minimum required fields are the `[[HOME_DOMAINS]]` and a set of `[[VALIDATORS]]`, so if you wanted to configure your instance for the public network, you would simply replace the above with their pubnet equivalents. 

If you wanted to adapt this to the **Stellar pubnet**, you'll need to think more carefully about the validators you want to trust in your quorum. As inspiration, [here](https://github.com/stellar/go/blob/master/services/horizon/docker/stellar-core-pubnet.cfg#L15-L202) is the set of domains and validators that SDF includes in its pubnet quorum.

Captive Core's functionality is controlled through this file. Note that while the Captive Core configuration looks like a subset of a traditional Stellar Core configuration file, you cannot use a traditional Stellar Core configuration file to configure Captive Core. The TOML format is preserved for operator ease of [migrating](./migrating.mdx) from Horizon 1.x, but this is a fundamentally different architecture and should be treated as such.


## Remote Captive Core

As mentioned [earlier](./installing.mdx#installing-remote-captive-core), we provide a library that wraps a Captive Core instance in an HTTP API that Horizon can consume remotely. This is an advanced (and still experimental) architecture, so refer to the [Remote Captive Core](./remote-core.mdx) page (up next) for more on setting that up.

Otherwise, jump ahead to [Running Horizon](./running.mdx)!
