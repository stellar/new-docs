## Parameters

Horizon can be configured by both command line flags or environment variables. To see the list of command line flags that are available, their default values, and their corresponding environmental variables for your version of Horizon, run:

    horizon --help

When you run the command above, you'll see that Horizon defines a large number of flags; however, only a handful are required:

| flag | envvar | example |
| ---- | ------ | ------- |
| `--db-url` | `DATABASE_URL` | postgres://localhost/horizon_testnet |
| `--captive-core-config-append-path` | `CAPTIVE_CORE_CONFIG_APPEND_PATH` | /etc/default/stellar-captive-core-stub.toml |
| `--stellar-core-url` | `STELLAR_CORE_URL` | http://localhost:11626 |
| `--stellar-core-binary-path` | `STELLAR_CORE_BINARY_PATH` | /usr/bin/stellar-core |

  - The most important parameter, `--db-url`, specifies the Horizon database, and its value should be a valid [PostgreSQL Connection URI](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.2/static/libpq-connect.html#AEN38419).
  - The second parameter, `--captive-core-config-append-path`, points to a Captive Core configuration stub. This stub file only requires a few fields (explained [below](#configuring-captive-core)) to get up and running. 
  - The final parameter, `--stellar-core-binary-path`, is a filesystem path to a Stellar Core binary. Since Horizon will search your `PATH` for `stellar-core` by default, if your environment is configured appropriately, you won't even need to pass this.

Note that Horizon will perform ingestion by default as of [v2.0](https://github.com/stellar/go/releases/tag/horizon-v2.0.0); if you want to have certain nodes dedicated exclusively to fulfilling requests, you should set `--enable-captive-core-ingestion=false`.

Specifying command line flags every time you invoke Horizon can be cumbersome, so we recommend using environment variables. There are many tools you can use to manage them: we recommend either [direnv](http://direnv.net/) or [dotenv](https://github.com/bkeepers/dotenv). However, **if you installed via [the package manager](./installing.mdx#package-manager),** the provided `stellar-horizon-cmd` wrapper will actually import a configuration from `/etc/default/stellar-horizon` and set up the environment accordingly.


## Preparing the Database

Before running the Horizon server, you must first prepare the Horizon database. This database will be used for all of the information produced by Horizon, notably historical information about successful transactions that have occurred on the stellar network.

To prepare a database for Horizon's use, you must first ensure the database is blank. It's easiest to simply create a new database on your PostgreSQL server specifically for Horizon's use. Next, you must install the schema by running `horizon db init`. Remember to use the appropriate command line flags or environment variables to configure Horizon as explained [above](#parameters). This command will log any errors that occur.

### Postgres Configuration
It is recommended to set `random_page_cost=1` in Postgres configuration if you are using SSD storage. With this setting, Query Planner will make a better use of indices, expecially for `JOIN` queries. We've noticed a huge speed improvement for some queries with this setting.


## Configuring Captive Core

While a full Stellar Core node requires a complex configuration with [lots of possible fields](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-core/blob/master/docs/stellar-core_example.cfg), the Captive Core configuration stub can be kept extremely barebones. The rest of the configuration will be generated automagically at runtime. Here's is a minimal working example, operating under the assumption that you want to connect to the testnet and trust SDF's validators exclusively:

<CodeExample>

```toml
[[HOME_DOMAINS]]
HOME_DOMAIN="testnet.stellar.org"
QUALITY="HIGH"

[[VALIDATORS]]
NAME="sdf_testnet_1"
HOME_DOMAIN="testnet.stellar.org"
PUBLIC_KEY="GDKXE2OZMJIPOSLNA6N6F2BVCI3O777I2OOC4BV7VOYUEHYX7RTRYA7Y"
ADDRESS="core-testnet1.stellar.org"
HISTORY="curl -sf http://history.stellar.org/prd/core-testnet/core_testnet_001/{0} -o {1}"

[[VALIDATORS]]
NAME="sdf_testnet_2"
HOME_DOMAIN="testnet.stellar.org"
PUBLIC_KEY="GCUCJTIYXSOXKBSNFGNFWW5MUQ54HKRPGJUTQFJ5RQXZXNOLNXYDHRAP"
ADDRESS="core-testnet2.stellar.org"
HISTORY="curl -sf http://history.stellar.org/prd/core-testnet/core_testnet_002/{0} -o {1}"

[[VALIDATORS]]
NAME="sdf_testnet_3"
HOME_DOMAIN="testnet.stellar.org"
PUBLIC_KEY="GC2V2EFSXN6SQTWVYA5EPJPBWWIMSD2XQNKUOHGEKB535AQE2I6IXV2Z"
ADDRESS="core-testnet3.stellar.org"
HISTORY="curl -sf http://history.stellar.org/prd/core-testnet/core_testnet_003/{0} -o {1}"
```

</CodeExample>

_(For the remainder of this guide, we'll assume this stub lives at `/etc/default/stellar-captive-core-stub.toml`.)_


## Remote Captive Core

If you want to run a Captive Core instance independently of your Horizon instances, the architecture supports that. We provide a package that wraps a Captive Core instance in an HTTP API that Horizon can consume.

### Configuring Core
We'll need to configure the Captive Core environment. The required parameters include the [above](#parameters), the [configuration stub](#configuring-captive-core), as well as a few others:

| flag | envvar | example |
| ---- | ------ | ------- |
| `--network-passphrase` | `NETWORK_PASSPHRASE` | `Test SDF Network ; September 2015` |
| `--history-archive-urls` | `HISTORY_ARCHIVE_URLS` | `https://history.stellar.org/prd/core-testnet/core_testnet_001,https://history.stellar.org/prd/core-testnet/core_testnet_002` |

For example, if you wanted to rely on SDF for history archives and connect to the test network, you might prepare your environment as follows:

<CodeExample>

```bash
export NETWORK_PASSPHRASE='Test SDF Network ; September 2015'
export HISTORY_ARCHIVE_URLS='https://history.stellar.org/prd/core-testnet/core_testnet_001'
export DATABASE_URL='postgres://postgres:secret@db.local:5432/horizon?sslmode=disable'
export CAPTIVE_CORE_CONFIG_APPEND_PATH=/etc/default/stellar-captive-core-stub.toml
```

</CodeExample>

(We suppose, of course, that the above PostgreSQL URI is a [correctly-configured](#preparing-the-database) database.)

### Configuring Horizon
On the *local* Horizon instance (i.e. the one htat will connect to the above-configured remote Captive Core), rather than passing the `--captive-core-config-append-path`, `--stellar-core-url`, and `--stellar-core-binary-path` parameters described [above](#parameters), we only need a single parameter:

| flag | envvar | example |
| ---- | ------ | ------- |
| `--remote-captive-core-url` | `REMOTE_CAPTIVE_CORE_URL` | http://10.0.0.42:8000 |

This URL should point to a running Captive Core API. Note that nothing prohibits this from being a `localhost` URL, if you want Captive Core running in a separate process from Horizon or are running a containerized setup, for example.
