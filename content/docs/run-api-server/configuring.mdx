## Parameters

Horizon can be configured by both command line flags or environment variables. To see the list of command line flags that are available, their default values, and their corresponding environmental variables for your version of Horizon, run:

<CodeExample>

    horizon --help

</CodeExample>

When you run the command above, you'll see that Horizon defines a large number of flags; however, only a handful are required:

| flag | envvar | example |
| ---- | ------ | ------- |
| `--db-url` | `DATABASE_URL` | postgres://localhost/horizon_testnet |
| `--captive-core-config-append-path` | `CAPTIVE_CORE_CONFIG_APPEND_PATH` | /etc/default/stellar-captive-core-stub.toml |
| `--stellar-core-binary-path` | `STELLAR_CORE_BINARY_PATH` | /usr/bin/stellar-core |

  - The most important parameter, `--db-url`, specifies the Horizon database; its value should be a valid [PostgreSQL Connection URI](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.6/static/libpq-connect.html#AEN46025).
  - The second parameter, `--captive-core-config-append-path`, points to a Captive Core configuration stub. This stub file only requires a few fields (explained [below](#configuring-captive-core)) to get up and running. 
  - The final parameter, `--stellar-core-binary-path`, is a filesystem path to a Stellar Core binary. Horizon will search your `PATH` for `stellar-core` by default, so if your environment is configured appropriately, you may not even need to pass this.

### Manual Installation
Specifying command line flags every time you invoke Horizon can be cumbersome, so we recommend using environment variables. There are many tools you can use to manage them: we recommend either [direnv](http://direnv.net/) or [dotenv](https://github.com/bkeepers/dotenv).

### Package Manager Installation
If you installed Horizon via [the package manager](./installing.mdx#package-manager), the provided `stellar-horizon-cmd` wrapper will actually import a configuration from `/etc/default/stellar-horizon` and set up the environment accordingly. Hence, if you want to change things up, simply edit this file.

Note that the default configuration provided by the package manager will **enable ingestion by default** (`INGEST=true`); refer to the later [Ingesting Transactions](./running.mdx#ingesting-transactions) section to see what setup is right for you. If you want certain nodes dedicated exclusively to fulfilling requests, you should drop this flag accordingly.


## Preparing the Database

Before running the Horizon server, you must first prepare the Horizon database. This database will be used for all of the information produced by Horizon, notably historical information about transactions that have occurred on the Stellar network.

To prepare a database for Horizon's use, you must first ensure the database is blank. It's easiest to simply create a new database on your PostgreSQL server specifically for Horizon's use (e.g. `createdb horizon`). You may also need to [add a role](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.6/sql-createrole.html) for yourself through the `postgres` user if you're starting from scratch. Next, install the schema by running `stellar-horizon db init`. This command will log any errors that occur.

Remember to use the appropriate command line flags or environment variables to configure Horizon as explained [above](#parameters), or use `stellar-horizon-cmd`.

### Postgres Configuration
It is recommended to set `random_page_cost=1` in Postgres' configuration if you are using SSD storage. With this setting, Query Planner will make a better use of indices, especially for `JOIN` queries. We've noticed a huge speed improvement for some queries with this setting.


## Configuring Captive Core

While a full Stellar Core node requires a complex configuration with [lots of possible fields](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-core/blob/master/docs/stellar-core_example.cfg), the Captive Core configuration stub can be kept extremely barebones. The rest of the configuration will be generated automagically at runtime. Here's is a minimal working example, operating under the assumption that you want to connect to the testnet and trust SDF's validators exclusively:

<CodeExample>

```toml
[[HOME_DOMAINS]]
HOME_DOMAIN="testnet.stellar.org"
QUALITY="HIGH"

[[VALIDATORS]]
NAME="sdf_testnet_1"
HOME_DOMAIN="testnet.stellar.org"
PUBLIC_KEY="GDKXE2OZMJIPOSLNA6N6F2BVCI3O777I2OOC4BV7VOYUEHYX7RTRYA7Y"
ADDRESS="core-testnet1.stellar.org"
HISTORY="curl -sf http://history.stellar.org/prd/core-testnet/core_testnet_001/{0} -o {1}"

[[VALIDATORS]]
NAME="sdf_testnet_2"
HOME_DOMAIN="testnet.stellar.org"
PUBLIC_KEY="GCUCJTIYXSOXKBSNFGNFWW5MUQ54HKRPGJUTQFJ5RQXZXNOLNXYDHRAP"
ADDRESS="core-testnet2.stellar.org"
HISTORY="curl -sf http://history.stellar.org/prd/core-testnet/core_testnet_002/{0} -o {1}"

[[VALIDATORS]]
NAME="sdf_testnet_3"
HOME_DOMAIN="testnet.stellar.org"
PUBLIC_KEY="GC2V2EFSXN6SQTWVYA5EPJPBWWIMSD2XQNKUOHGEKB535AQE2I6IXV2Z"
ADDRESS="core-testnet3.stellar.org"
HISTORY="curl -sf http://history.stellar.org/prd/core-testnet/core_testnet_003/{0} -o {1}"
```

</CodeExample>

_(For the remainder of this guide, we'll assume this stub lives at `/etc/default/stellar-captive-core-stub.toml`.)_

The minimum required fields are the `[[HOME_DOMAINS]]` and a set of `[[VALIDATORS]]`, so if you wanted to configure your instance for the public network, you would simply replace the above with their pubnet equivalents. As inspiration, [here](https://github.com/stellar/go/blob/master/services/horizon/docker/stellar-core-pubnet.cfg#L15-L202) is the set of domains and validators that SDF configures on the pubnet.

Note that while the Captive Core stub looks a lot like the true Stellar Core configuration file, **this should not be relied upon**. Horizon provides defaults for certain fields, others can be specified from the command line, while others still may be changed or introduced in the future. The TOML format is preserved for operator ease of upgrading from Horizon 1.x, but this is a fundamentally different architecture and should be treated as such.


## Remote Captive Core

As mentioned [earlier](./installing.mdx#installing-remote-captive-core), we provide a library that wraps a Captive Core instance in an HTTP API that Horizon can consume remotely. 

This is an advanced (and still experimental) architecture, so refer to the [Remote Captive Core](./remote-core.mdx) page for more on setting that up.
