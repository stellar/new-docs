To install Horizon, you have a choice: you can download a
[prebuilt release for your target architecture](https://github.com/stellar/go/releases)
and operation system or you can [build Horizon yourself](#Building). When either
approach is complete, you will find yourself with a directory containing a file
named `horizon`. This file is a native binary.

After building or unpacking Horizon, you simply need to copy the native binary
into a directory that is part of your PATH. Most unix-like systems have
`/usr/local/bin` in PATH by default, so unless you have a preference or know
better, we recommend you copy the binary there.

To test the installation, simply run `horizon --help` from a terminal. If the
help for Horizon is displayed, your installation was successful. Note: some
shells, such as zsh, cache PATH lookups. You may need to clear your cache (by
using `rehash` in zsh, for example) before trying to run `horizon --help`.

## Building

Should you decide not to use one of our prebuilt releases, you may instead build
Horizon from source. To do so, you need to install some developer tools:

- A unix-like operating system with the common core commands (cp, tar, mkdir,
  bash, etc.)
- A compatible distribution of Go (Go 1.13 or later)
- [git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [mercurial](https://www.mercurial-scm.org/)

1. See the details in [README.md](../../../../README.md#dependencies) for
   installing dependencies.
2. Compile the Horizon binary:
   `go install github.com/stellar/go/services/horizon`. You should see the
   `horizon` binary in `$GOPATH/bin`.
3. Add Go binaries to your PATH in your `bashrc` or equivalent, for easy access:
   `export PATH=${GOPATH//://bin:}/bin:$PATH`

Open a new terminal. Confirm everything worked by running `horizon --help`
successfully.

Note: Building directly on windows is not supported.
