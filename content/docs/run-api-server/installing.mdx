## Installation Methods

To install Horizon, you have a few choices. You can...
  - install prebuilt binaries [from our repositories](#package-manager) via your package manager if running a Debian-based system,
  - download a [prebuilt release](https://github.com/stellar/go/releases) for your target architecture and operation system, or
  - [build Horizon yourself](#building) from scratch. 

The first method is recommended: not only do you ensure OS compatibility and dependency management, you'll also install some convenient wrappers that make running Horizon and Stellar-Core much simpler.

### Package Manager
SDF publishes new releases to its custom Ubuntu repositories. Follow [this guide](https://github.com/stellar/packages/blob/master/docs/adding-the-sdf-stable-repository-to-your-system.md#adding-the-sdf-stable-repository-to-your-system) to add the stable SDF repository to your system. Then, 

<CodeExample>

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install stellar-captive-core stellar-horizon
```

</CodeExample>

[This page](https://github.com/stellar/packages/blob/master/docs/installing-individual-packages.md#installing-individual-packages) outlines the various commands that these packages make available.

### Building
Should you decide not to use one of our prebuilt releases, you may instead build Horizon from source. To do so, you need to install some developer tools:

- A Unix-like operating system with the common core commands (cp, tar, mkdir, bash, etc.)
- A compatible distribution of Go (Go 1.13 or later)
- [git](https://git-scm.com/)

**Note**: Though Horizon should run on Windows, *building* directly on Windows is not supported.

First, refer to the details of [README.md](https://github.com/stellar/go/blob/master/README.md#dependencies) for installing dependencies. Then, you can build the Horizon binary pretty easily:

<CodeExample>

```bash
git clone https://github.com/stellar/go monorepo && cd monorepo
go install -v ./services/horizon
sudo cp $(go env GOPATH)/bin/horizon /usr/bin/stellar-horizon
```

</CodeExample>

_(You should refer to the list of [Horizon releases](https://github.com/stellar/go/releases) and `git checkout` accordingly if you're looking for a stable release rather than the bleeding edge `master` branch.)_

At this point, you can either add Go binaries to your PATH in your `bashrc` or equivalent:

<CodeExample>

```bash
export PATH=${GOPATH//://bin:}/bin:$PATH
```

</CodeExample>

or just copy the binary from the `GOPATH` to the system PATH:

<CodeExample>

```bash
cp $(go env GOPATH)/bin/horizon /usr/bin/stellar-horizon
```

</CodeExample>


## Installing Remote Captive Core

If you are [configuring a remote Captive Core](./configuring#remote-captive-core) instance, you'll need some additional binaries on that machine.

### From Repositories
After setting up repositories as described [above](#package-manager), you'll need to install the following packages on that machine:

<CodeExample>

```bash
apt install stellar-captive-core stellar-captive-core-api
```

</CodeExample>

### From Source
Alternatively, you can install the bleeding edge [from source](https://github.com/stellar/go/exp/services/captivecore):

<CodeExample>

```bash
git clone https://github.com/stellar/go monorepo && cd monorepo
go install -v ./exp/services/captivecore
sudo cp $(go env GOPATH)/bin/captivecore /usr/bin/stellar-captive-core-api
```

</CodeExample>


## Conclusion
If you [built from source](#building) or downloaded a release [from GitHub](https://github.com/stellar/go/releases), you simply need to copy the native binary into a directory that is part of your PATH. Most Unix-like systems have `/usr/local/bin` in PATH by default, so unless you have a preference or know better, we recommend you copy the binary there:

<CodeExample>

```bash
sudo cp horizon /usr/local/bin/stellar-horizon
```

</CodeExample>

_(We've renamed it here to keep it consistent with the results of the recommended [Package Manager](#package-manager) method.)_

To test your installation, simply run `stellar-horizon --help` from a terminal. If the help for Horizon is displayed, your installation was successful.

**Note**: Some shells (such as [zsh](https://www.zsh.org/)) cache PATH lookups. You may need to clear your cache (by using `rehash` in zsh, for example) or restart your shell before trying to run the aforementioned command.
