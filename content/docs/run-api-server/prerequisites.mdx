Horizon only has one dependency: a PostgreSQL server that it uses to store data that has been processed and ingested from Stellar Core. Horizon requires PostgreSQL version >= 9.5.

As far as system requirements go, there's one main thing to keep in mind: your machines should have enough extra RAM to hold Captive Core's in-memory database (~3GB). A secondary requirement depends on how much of the network's history you'd like to serve from your Horizon instance; this could be anywhere from a few gigabytes to tens of terabytes for the full ingested ledger history.
