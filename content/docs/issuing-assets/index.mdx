The ability to issue assets is a core feature of Stellar.  In a few simple operations, you can create Stellar-network tokens, and this section of the docs will show you how.  

The possibilities are endless: any asset can be tokenized, and, once tokenized, transferred or traded over the Stellar network quickly and cheaply.  Since any account can issue an asset on the Stellar network and anyone can set up a Stellar account, _anyone_ can issue an asset: banks, payment processors, money service businesses of all stripes, for-profit enterprises, nonprofits, local communities, even individuals.  It’s a self-serve process, no permission needed.

In addition to making it easy to issue an asset, Stellar also provides built-in mechanisms that allow you to tune your asset to specific use cases.  You can — and should — [publish important identifying information](publishing-asset-info.mdx) about your asset so that wallets and consumers know what it represents, and it's easy to link that info to your asset in a single step.  To comply with regulations, you can [control access](control-asset-access.mdx) to your asset using protocol-level flags.  To take advantage of Stellar’s global reach, you can [list your asset](list-asset-on-dex.mdx) on the Stellar decentralized exchange, and use [market making bots](https://kelpbot.io/) to ensure necessary liquidity.    
 
Currently, the biggest use case for Stellar is the tokenization of fiat currency to optimize processes like cross-border payments, so there’s also a whole subsequent section — [Enable Deposit and Withdrawal](../enabling-deposit-and-withdrawal/index.mdx) — that focuses on how to connect Stellar tokens to existing rails to allow users to easily deposit real-world assets in exchange for them, and, on the flipside, to redeem them for real-world assets.  Check that section if you're interested in creating an accessible on/off ramp that interoperates with wallets for seamless handling of user KYC, deposits, and withdrawals.

As more and more developers and businesses explore other possibilities, we’ll expand the docs to cover emerging ideas and applications.
