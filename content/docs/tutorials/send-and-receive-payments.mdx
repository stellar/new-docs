import { CodeExample } from "components/CodeExample";

Most of the time, you’ll be sending money to someone else who has their own account. For this
tutorial, however, you'll need a second account to transact with.  So before proceeding, follow the steps outlined in [Create an Account](./create-account.md) to make a both sending account and a recipient account.


## About Operations and Transactions

Actions that do things on Stellar, like sending payments or making
buy or sell offers, are called [operations](link). In order to actually
perform an operation, you create a **transaction**, which is just a group of anywhere from 1 to 100 operations accompanied
by some extra information, like which account is making the transaction and a cryptographic
signature to verify that the transaction is authentic.

Transactions are atomic, meaning that if any operation in a transaction fails, they all fail. Let’s say you have 100
lumens and you make two payment operations of 60 lumens each. If you make two transactions (each
with one operation), the first will succeed and the second will fail because you don’t have enough
lumens. You’ll be left with 40 lumens. However, if you group the two payments into a single
transaction, they will both fail and you’ll be left with the full 100 lumens still in your account.

Every transaction also incurs a small fee. Like the minimum balance on accounts, this fee deters spam and prevents people from overloading the system. This [base fee](link) is
very small — 100 stroops per operation where a stroop equals 1 * 10 ^-7 XLM — and it's charged for each operation in a transaction. A transaction with two operations, for instance, would cost 200 stroops.

## Send a Payment

Stellar stores and communicates transaction data in a binary format called [XDR](link), which is optimized for network performance but unreadable to the human eye. Luckily, [Horizon](link), the Stellar API, and the
Stellar SDKs convert XDRs into friendlier formats. Here’s how you might send 10 lumens to an account:

<CodeExample>

```js
var StellarSdk = require('stellar-sdk');
var server = new StellarSdk.Server('https://horizon-testnet.stellar.org');
var sourceKeys = StellarSdk.Keypair
  .fromSecret('SCZANGBA5YHTNYVVV4C3U252E2B6P6F5T3U6MM63WBSBZATAQI3EBTQ4');
var destinationId = 'GA2C5RFPE6GCKMY3US5PAB6UZLKIGSPIUKSLRB6Q723BM2OARMDUYEJ5';
// Transaction will hold a built transaction we can resubmit if the result is unknown.
var transaction;

// First, check to make sure that the destination account exists.
// You could skip this, but if the account does not exist, you will be charged
// the transaction fee when the transaction fails.
server.loadAccount(destinationId)
  // If the account is not found, surface a nicer error message for logging.
  .catch(function (error) {
    if (error instanceof StellarSdk.NotFoundError) {
      throw new Error('The destination account does not exist!');
    } else return error
  })
  // If there was no error, load up-to-date information on your account.
  .then(function() {
    return server.loadAccount(sourceKeys.publicKey());
  })
  .then(function(sourceAccount) {
    // Start building the transaction.
    transaction = new StellarSdk.TransactionBuilder(sourceAccount, {
      fee: StellarSdk.BASE_FEE,
      networkPassphrase: StellarSdk.Networks.TESTNET
    })
      .addOperation(StellarSdk.Operation.payment({
        destination: destinationId,
        // Because Stellar allows transaction in many currencies, you must
        // specify the asset type. The special "native" asset represents Lumens.
        asset: StellarSdk.Asset.native(),
        amount: "10"
      }))
      // A memo allows you to add your own metadata to a transaction. It's
      // optional and does not affect how Stellar treats the transaction.
      .addMemo(StellarSdk.Memo.text('Test Transaction'))
      // Wait a maximum of three minutes for the transaction
      .setTimeout(180)
      .build();
    // Sign the transaction to prove you are actually the person sending it.
    transaction.sign(sourceKeys);
    // And finally, send it off to Stellar!
    return server.submitTransaction(transaction);
  })
  .then(function(result) {
    console.log('Success! Results:', result);
  })
  .catch(function(error) {
    console.error('Something went wrong!', error);
    // If the result is unknown (no response body, timeout etc.) we simply resubmit
    // already built transaction:
    // server.submitTransaction(transaction);
  });
```

```java
Network.useTestNetwork();
Server server = new Server("https://horizon-testnet.stellar.org");

KeyPair source = KeyPair.fromSecretSeed("SCZANGBA5YHTNYVVV4C3U252E2B6P6F5T3U6MM63WBSBZATAQI3EBTQ4");
KeyPair destination = KeyPair.fromAccountId("GA2C5RFPE6GCKMY3US5PAB6UZLKIGSPIUKSLRB6Q723BM2OARMDUYEJ5");

// First, check to make sure that the destination account exists.
// You could skip this, but if the account does not exist, you will be charged
// the transaction fee when the transaction fails.
// It will throw HttpResponseException if account does not exist or there was another error.
server.accounts().account(destination);

// If there was no error, load up-to-date information on your account.
AccountResponse sourceAccount = server.accounts().account(source);

// Start building the transaction.
Transaction transaction = new Transaction.Builder(sourceAccount)
        .addOperation(new PaymentOperation.Builder(destination, new AssetTypeNative(), "10").build())
        // A memo allows you to add your own metadata to a transaction. It's
        // optional and does not affect how Stellar treats the transaction.
        .addMemo(Memo.text("Test Transaction"))
        // Wait a maximum of three minutes for the transaction
        .setTimeout(180)
        .build();
// Sign the transaction to prove you are actually the person sending it.
transaction.sign(source);

// And finally, send it off to Stellar!
try {
  SubmitTransactionResponse response = server.submitTransaction(transaction);
  System.out.println("Success!");
  System.out.println(response);
} catch (Exception e) {
  System.out.println("Something went wrong!");
  System.out.println(e.getMessage());
  // If the result is unknown (no response body, timeout etc.) we simply resubmit
  // already built transaction:
  // SubmitTransactionResponse response = server.submitTransaction(transaction);

from stellar_sdk.keypair import Keypair
from stellar_sdk.network import Network
from stellar_sdk.server import Server
from stellar_sdk.transaction_builder import TransactionBuilder

        # optional and does not affect how Stellar treats the transaction.
        .add_text_memo("Test Transaction")
        # Wait a maximum of three minutes for the transaction
        .set_timeout(10)
        .build()

try:
    # And finally, send it off to Stellar!
    response = server.submit_transaction(transaction)
    print(f"Response: {response}")
except (BadRequestError, BadResponseError) as err:
    print(f"Something went wrong!\n{err}")
```

</CodeExample>

What exactly happened there? Let’s break it down.

1. Confirm that the account ID you are sending to actually exists by loading the associated account
   data from the Stellar network. Everything will actually be OK if you skip this step, but
   it gives you an opportunity to avoid making a transaction that will inevitably fail. 
    
    <CodeExample>

    ```js
    server.loadAccount(destinationId)
      .then(function(account) { /* validate the account */ })
    ```

    ```java
    server.accounts().account(destination);
    ```

    ```go
        if _, err := horizon.DefaultTestNetClient.LoadAccount(destination); err != nil {
            panic(err)
        }
    ```

    ```python
    server.load_account(destination_id)
    ```

    </CodeExample>

2. Load data for the account you are sending from. An account can only perform one transaction at a
   time and has something called a [**sequence
   number**,](link) which helps Stellar verify the order of
   transactions. A transaction’s sequence number needs to match the account’s sequence number, so
   you need to get the account’s current sequence number from the network.

    <CodeExample>

    ```js
    .then(function() {
    return server.loadAccount(sourceKeys.publicKey());
    })
    ```

    ```java
    AccountResponse sourceAccount = server.accounts().account(source);
    ```

    ```python
    source_account = server.load_account(source_key.public_key)
    ```

    </CodeExample>

    The SDK will automatically increment the account’s sequence number when you build a
    transaction, so you won’t need to retrieve this information again if you want to perform a
    second transaction.

3. Start building a transaction. This requires an account object, not just an account ID, because
   it will increment the account’s sequence number.

    <CodeExample>

    ```js
    var transaction = new StellarSdk.TransactionBuilder(sourceAccount)
    ```

    ```java
    Transaction transaction = new Transaction.Builder(sourceAccount)
    ```

    ```go
        tx, err := build.Transaction(
        // ...
        )
    ```

    ```python
    transaction = TransactionBuilder(
        source_account=source_account,
        network_passphrase=Network.TESTNET_NETWORK_PASSPHRASE,
        base_fee=base_fee
    )
    ```

    </CodeExample>

4. Add the payment operation to the account. Note that you need to specify the type of asset you
   are sending: Stellar’s network currency is the [lumen](link), but you can send any asset issued on the network.  We'll cover sending non-lumen assets [below](#transacting-in-other-currencies). For now, though, we’ll stick to
   lumens, which are called “native” assets in the SDK:

    <CodeExample>

    ```js
    .addOperation(StellarSdk.Operation.payment({
      destination: destinationId,
      asset: StellarSdk.Asset.native(),
      amount: "10"
    }))
    ```

    ```java
    .addOperation(new PaymentOperation.Builder(destination, new AssetTypeNative(), "10").build())
    ```

    ```go
    tx, err := build.Transaction(
        build.TestNetwork,
        build.SourceAccount{source},
        build.AutoSequence{horizon.DefaultTestNetClient},
        build.MemoText{"Test Transaction"},
        build.Payment(
            build.Destination{destination},
            build.NativeAmount{"10"},
        ),
    )
    ```

    ```python
    .append_payment_op(destination=destination_id, amount="10", asset_code="XLM")
    ```

    </CodeExample>

    You should also note that the amount is a string rather than a number. When working with
    extremely small fractions or large values, [floating point math can introduce small
    inaccuracies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating_point#Accuracy_problems). Since not all
    systems have a native way to accurately represent extremely small or large decimals, Stellar
    uses strings as a reliable way to represent the exact amount across any system.

5. Optionally, you can add your own metadata, called a
   [**memo,**](../concepts/transactions.md#memo) to a transaction. Stellar doesn’t do anything with
   this data, but you can use it for any purpose you’d like.  Many exchanges require memos for incoming transactions because they use a single Stellar account for all their users, and rely on the memo to differentiate between internal user accounts.

    <CodeExample name="Add a Memo">

    ```js
    .addMemo(StellarSdk.Memo.text('Test Transaction'))
    ```

    ```java
    .addMemo(Memo.text("Test Transaction"));
    ```

    ```go
    build.MemoText{"Test Transaction"},
    ```

    ```python
    .add_text_memo("Test Transaction")
    ```

    </CodeExample>

6. Now that the transaction has all the data it needs, you have to cryptographically sign it using
   your secret key. This proves that the data actually came from you and not someone impersonating
   you.

    <CodeExample>

    ```js
    transaction.sign(sourceKeys);
    ```

    ```java
    transaction.sign(source);
    ```

    ```go
    txe, err := tx.Sign(source)
    txeB64, err := txe.Base64()
    ```

    ```python
    transaction.sign(source_key)
    ```

    </CodeExample>

7. And finally, submit it to the Stellar network!

    <CodeExample>

    ```js
    server.submitTransaction(transaction);
    ```

    ```java
    server.submitTransaction(transaction);
    ```

    ```go
    resp, err := horizon.DefaultTestNetClient.SubmitTransaction(txeB64)
    ```

    ``` python
    server.submit_transaction(transaction)
    ```
    </CodeExample>

In this example, we're submitting the transaction to the SDF-maintained public testnet instance of Horizon, the Stellar API.  When submitting transactions to a Horizon server — which is what most people do — it's possible that you will not receive a response from due to a bug, network conditions, etc. In such a situation it's impossible to determine the status of your
transaction. That's why you should always save a built transaction (or transaction encoded in XDR
format) in a variable or a database and resubmit it if you don't know its status. If the
transaction has already been successfully applied to the ledger, Horizon will simply return the
saved result and not attempt to submit the transaction again. Only in cases where a transaction’s
status is unknown (and thus will have a chance of being included into a ledger) will a resubmission
to the network occur.

## Receive a Payment

You don’t actually need to do anything to receive payments into a Stellar account: if a payer makes
a successful transaction to send assets to you, those assets will automatically be added to your
account.

However, you may want keep an eye out for incoming payments.  A simple program that watches the network for payments and prints each one might look like:

<CodeExample name="Receive Payments">

```js
var StellarSdk = require('stellar-sdk');

var server = new StellarSdk.Server('https://horizon-testnet.stellar.org');
var accountId = 'GC2BKLYOOYPDEFJKLKY6FNNRQMGFLVHJKQRGNSSRRGSMPGF32LHCQVGF';

// Create an API call to query payments involving the account.
var payments = server.payments().forAccount(accountId);

// If some payments have already been handled, start the results from the
// last seen payment. (See below in `handlePayment` where it gets saved.)
var lastToken = loadLastPagingToken();
if (lastToken) {
  payments.cursor(lastToken);
}

// `stream` will send each recorded payment, one by one, then keep the
// connection open and continue to send you new payments as they occur.
payments.stream({
  onmessage: function(payment) {
    // Record the paging token so we can start from here next time.
    savePagingToken(payment.paging_token);

    // The payments stream includes both sent and received payments. We only
    // want to process received payments here.
    if (payment.to !== accountId) {
      return;
    }

    // In Stellar’s API, Lumens are referred to as the “native” type. Other
    // asset types have more detailed information.
    var asset;
    if (payment.asset_type === 'native') {
      asset = 'lumens';
    }
    else {
      asset = payment.asset_code + ':' + payment.asset_issuer;
    }

    console.log(payment.amount + ' ' + asset + ' from ' + payment.from);
  },

  onerror: function(error) {
    console.error('Error in payment stream');
  }
});

function savePagingToken(token) {
  // In most cases, you should save this to a local database or file so that
  // you can load it next time you stream new payments.
}

function loadLastPagingToken() {
  // Get the last paging token from a local database or file
}
```

```java
Server server = new Server("https://horizon-testnet.stellar.org");
KeyPair account = KeyPair.fromAccountId("GC2BKLYOOYPDEFJKLKY6FNNRQMGFLVHJKQRGNSSRRGSMPGF32LHCQVGF");

// Create an API call to query payments involving the account.
PaymentsRequestBuilder paymentsRequest = server.payments().forAccount(account);

// If some payments have already been handled, start the results from the
// last seen payment. (See below in `handlePayment` where it gets saved.)
String lastToken = loadLastPagingToken();
if (lastToken != null) {
  paymentsRequest.cursor(lastToken);
}

// `stream` will send each recorded payment, one by one, then keep the
// connection open and continue to send you new payments as they occur.
paymentsRequest.stream(new EventListener<OperationResponse>() {
  @Override
  public void onEvent(OperationResponse payment) {
    // Record the paging token so we can start from here next time.
    savePagingToken(payment.getPagingToken());

    // The payments stream includes both sent and received payments. We only
    // want to process received payments here.
    if (payment instanceof PaymentOperationResponse) {
      if (((PaymentOperationResponse) payment).getTo().equals(account)) {
        return;
      }

      String amount = ((PaymentOperationResponse) payment).getAmount();

      Asset asset = ((PaymentOperationResponse) payment).getAsset();
      String assetName;
      if (asset.equals(new AssetTypeNative())) {
        assetName = "lumens";
      } else {
        StringBuilder assetNameBuilder = new StringBuilder();
        assetNameBuilder.append(((AssetTypeCreditAlphaNum) asset).getCode());
        assetNameBuilder.append(":");
        assetNameBuilder.append(((AssetTypeCreditAlphaNum) asset).getIssuer().getAccountId());
        assetName = assetNameBuilder.toString();
      }

      StringBuilder output = new StringBuilder();
      output.append(amount);
      output.append(" ");
      output.append(assetName);
      output.append(" from ");
      output.append(((PaymentOperationResponse) payment).getFrom().getAccountId());
      System.out.println(output.toString());
    }

  }
});

    pass

server = Server("https://horizon-testnet.stellar.org")
account_id = "GC2BKLYOOYPDEFJKLKY6FNNRQMGFLVHJKQRGNSSRRGSMPGF32LHCQVGF"

# Create an API call to query payments involving the account.
payments = server.payments().for_account(account_id)

# If some payments have already been handled, start the results from the
# last seen payment. (See below in `handle_payment` where it gets saved.)
last_token = load_last_paging_token()
if last_token:
    payments.cursor(last_token)

# `stream` will send each recorded payment, one by one, then keep the
# connection open and continue to send you new payments as they occur.
for payment in payments.stream():
    # Record the paging token so we can start from here next time.
    save_paging_token(payment["paging_token"])

    # We only process `payment`, ignore `create_account` and `account_merge`.
    if payment["type"] != "payment":
        continue

    # The payments stream includes both sent and received payments. We
    # only want to process received payments here.
    if payment['to'] != account_id:
        continue

    # In Stellar’s API, Lumens are referred to as the “native” type. Other
    # asset types have more detailed information.
    if payment["asset_type"] == "native":
        asset = "Lumens"
    else:
        asset = f"{payment['asset_code']}:{payment['asset_issuer']}"
    print(f"{payment['amount']} {asset} from {payment['from']}")
```

</CodeExample>

There are two main parts to this program. First, you create a query for payments involving a given
account. Like most queries in Stellar, this could return a huge number of items, so the API returns
paging tokens, which you can use later to start your query from the same point where you previously
left off. In the example above, the functions to save and load paging tokens are left blank, but in
a real application, you’d want to save the paging tokens to a file or database so you can pick up
where you left off in case the program crashes or the user closes it.

<CodeExample>

```js
var payments = server.payments().forAccount(accountId);
var lastToken = loadLastPagingToken();
if (lastToken) {
  payments.cursor(lastToken);
}
```

```java
PaymentsRequestBuilder paymentsRequest = server.payments().forAccount(account)
String lastToken = loadLastPagingToken();
if (lastToken != null) {
  paymentsRequest.cursor(lastToken);
}
```

```python
payments = server.payments().for_account(account_id)
last_token = load_last_paging_token()
if last_token:
    payments.cursor(last_token)
```

</CodeExample>

Second, the results of the query are streamed. This is the easiest way to watch for payments or
other transactions. Each existing payment is sent through the stream, one by one. Once all existing
payments have been sent, the stream stays open and new payments are sent as they are made.

Try it out: Run this program, and then, in another window, create and submit a payment. You should
see this program log the payment.

<CodeExample>

```js
payments.stream({
  onmessage: function(payment) {
    // handle a payment
  }
});
```

```java
paymentsRequest.stream(new EventListener<OperationResponse>() {
  @Override
  public void onEvent(OperationResponse payment) {
    // Handle a payment
  }
});
```

```python
for payment in payments.stream():
    # handle a payment
```

</CodeExample>

You can also request payments in groups or pages. Once you’ve processed each page of payments,
you’ll need to request the next one until there are none left.

<CodeExample>

```js
payments.call().then(function handlePage(paymentsPage) {
  paymentsPage.records.forEach(function(payment) {
    // handle a payment
  });
  return paymentsPage.next().then(handlePage);
});
```

```java
Page<OperationResponse> page = payments.execute();

for (OperationResponse operation : page.getRecords()) {
    // handle a payment
}

page = page.getNextPage();
```

```python
payments_current = payments.call()
payments_next = payments.next()
```

</CodeExample>


## Transacting in Other Currencies

One of the amazing things about the Stellar network is that you can create, hold, send, receive, and trade many types of
assets, such as US dollars, Nigerian naira, bitcoin, or even your own new kind of asset.

While Stellar’s native asset, the lumen, is fairly simple, all other assets can be thought of like
a credit issued by a particular account. In fact, when you trade US dollars on the Stellar network,
you don’t actually trade US dollars—you trade US dollars *from a particular account.* That’s why
the assets in the example above had both a `code` and an `issuer`. The `issuer` is the ID of the
account that created the asset. Understanding what account issued the asset is important: to redeem a Stellar-network dollar , you return it to the issuer, who honors the credit with an actual dollar bill or a dollar in the bank.  To find out more about how that works, check out [Enable Deposits and Withdrawals](link). 

Stellar also supports payments sent as one type of asset and received as another. You can send
Nigerian naira to a friend in Germany and have them receive euros. These multi-currency
transactions, which are called [path payments](link), are made possible by a built-in market mechanism where people can make offers to buy
and sell different types of assets. Stellar will automatically find the best exchange
rates to convert your naira to euros. This system is called [distributed
exchange](../concepts/exchange.md).

You can read more about the details of assets in [Issuing Assets](link).
