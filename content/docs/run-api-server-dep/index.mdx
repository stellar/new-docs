**Note**: This section outlines a **deprecated** way of setting up a new, production Horizon deployment. We're leaving it around for posterity while we improve the docs outliningthe [new, recommended way](../run-api-server/index.mdx) of deploying Horizon 2.0+.

Horizon is responsible for providing an HTTP API to data in the Stellar network. It ingests and re-serves the data produced by the stellar network in a form that is easier to consume than the performance-oriented data representations used by stellar-core.

This document describes how to administer a **production** Horizon instance. If you are just starting with Horizon and want to deploy it quickly to test it out, consider the [Quickstart Guide](./quickstart.mdx) instead. For information about developing on the Horizon codebase, check out the [Development Guide](https://github.com/stellar/go/blob/master/services/horizon/internal/docs/developing.md).

## Why Run Horizon?

You don't need to run your own Horizon instance to build on Stellar: the Stellar Development Foundation runs two Horizon servers, one for the public network and one for the test network: https://horizon.stellar.org and https://horizon-testnet.stellar.org. These servers are free for anyone to use, and should be fine for development and small-scale projects. They are, however, rate limited, and we don't recommended using them for production services that need strong reliability.

Running Horizon within your own infrastructure provides a number of benefits. You can:

- Disable request rate limiting for guaranteed network access
- Have full operational control without dependency on the Stellar Development Foundation
- Run multiple instances for redundancy and scalability
