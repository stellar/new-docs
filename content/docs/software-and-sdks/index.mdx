title: Overview

The Go SDK is a set of packages for interacting with most aspects of the Stellar ecosystem. The primary component is the Horizon SDK, which provides convenient access to Horizon services. There are also packages for other Stellar services such as [TOML support](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/ecosystem/sep-0001.md) and [federation](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/ecosystem/sep-0002.md).

## Horizon SDK

The Horizon SDK is composed of two complementary libraries: `txnbuild` + `horizonclient`.
The `txnbuild` ([source](https://github.com/stellar/go/tree/master/txnbuild), [docs](https://godoc.org/github.com/stellar/go/txnbuild)) package enables the construction, signing and encoding of Stellar [transactions](https://www.stellar.org/developers/guides/concepts/transactions.html) and [operations](https://www.stellar.org/developers/guides/concepts/list-of-operations.html) in Go. The `horizonclient` ([source](https://github.com/stellar/go/tree/master/clients/horizonclient), [docs](https://godoc.org/github.com/stellar/go/clients/horizonclient)) package provides a web client for interfacing with [Horizon](https://www.stellar.org/developers/guides/get-started/) server REST endpoints to retrieve ledger information, and to submit transactions built with `txnbuild`.

## List of major SDK packages

- `horizonclient` ([source](https://github.com/stellar/go/tree/master/clients/horizonclient), [docs](https://godoc.org/github.com/stellar/go/clients/horizonclient)) - programmatic client access to Horizon
- `txnbuild` ([source](https://github.com/stellar/go/tree/master/txnbuild), [docs](https://godoc.org/github.com/stellar/go/txnbuild)) - construction, signing and encoding of Stellar transactions and operations
- `stellartoml` ([source](https://github.com/stellar/go/tree/master/clients/stellartoml), [docs](https://godoc.org/github.com/stellar/go/clients/stellartoml)) - parse [Stellar.toml](../../guides/concepts/stellar-toml.md) files from the internet
- `federation` ([source](https://godoc.org/github.com/stellar/go/clients/federation)) - resolve federation addresses  into stellar account IDs, suitable for use within a transaction

# Software



## [Stellar Core](../stellar-core/software/admin.md)
Stellar Core is the backbone of the Stellar network and does the hard work of validating and agreeing on the status of every transaction with other instances of Core through the Stellar Consensus Protocol (SCP).

## [Horizon](https://github.com/stellar/go/tree/master/services/horizon)
Horizon is the client-facing API server for the Stellar ecosystem. It acts as the interface between Stellar Core and applications that want to access the Stellar network. If you are running Stellar Core, you will probably also want to run Horizon.

# Reference Implementations

## [Federation Server](https://github.com/stellar/go/tree/master/services/federation)
A standalone Federation protocol server designed to be dropped in to your existing infrastructure. It can be configured to pull the data it needs out of your existing SQL database.

# Tools

## [Laboratory](https://www.stellar.org/laboratory/)
Interactive way to learn the Stellar API. The source is available [here](https://github.com/stellar/laboratory).

## [Account Viewer](https://www.stellar.org/account-viewer/)
Check your balance and send simple payments. This basic client is built on top of [Interstellar](https://github.com/stellar/interstellar) and connects to the live Stellar network. The source is available [here](https://github.com/stellar/account-viewer).

## [Dashboard](http://dashboard.stellar.org)
Current status of the live and test networks. The source is available [here](https://github.com/stellar/dashboard).

## [Archivist](https://github.com/stellar/go/tree/master/tools/stellar-archivist)
This is a small tool, written in Go, for working with stellar-core history archives directly. It is a standalone tool that does not require stellar-core, or any other programs.
