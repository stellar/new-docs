title: Sponsored Reserves
order:
---

Protocol 14 introduces operations that allow an account to pay the base reserves for another account. This is done by using the [Begin Sponsoring Future Reserves](../start/list-of-operations.mdx#begin-sponsoring-future-reserves) and [End Sponsoring Future Reserves](../start/list-of-operations.mdx#end-sponsoring-future-reserves) operations.

The sponsoring account establishes the is-sponsoring-future-reserves-for relationship, and the sponsored account terminates it. While this relationship exists, reserve requirements that would normally accumulate on the sponsored account will now accumulate on the sponsoring account. Both operations must appear in a single transaction, which guarantees that both the sponsoring and sponsored accounts agree to every sponsorship.

## Sponsorship effect on Minimum Balance

The [Minimum Balance](./minimum-balance.mdx) calculation once sponsorships are introduced becomes `(2 + numSubEntries + numSponsoring - numSponsored) * baseReserve + liabilities.selling`.

When account `A` is-sponsoring-future-reserves-for account `B`, any reserve requirements that would normally accumulate on `B` will instead accumulate on `A` as reflected in `numSponsoring`. The fact that these reserves are being provided by another account will be reflected on `B` in `numSponsored`, which will cancel out the increase in `numSubEntries`, keeping the minimum balance unchanged for `B`.

When a sponsored ledger entry or sub-entry is removed, `numSponsoring` is decreased on the sponsoring account and `numSponsored` is decreased on the sponsored account.

## What can be sponsored?

Anything that increases the minimum balance can be sponsored (Accounts, Offers, Trustlines, AccountData, and Signers).

## Claimable Balances

[Claimable Balances](./claimable-balance.mdx) are unique in that they must be sponsored. They are not sub-entries of an account, so the sponsoring account uses the sponsorship mechanism to pay the base reserve by increasing `numSponsoring`. The sponsorship logic is handled through the Claimable Balance operations, so the use of sponsorships is transparent to the user.

## Relevant operations

### Begin and end sponsorships

[Begin Sponsoring Future Reserves](../start/list-of-operations.mdx#begin-sponsoring-future-reserves) will establish the is-sponsoring-future-reserves-for relationship where the sponsoring account is the source account of the operation, and the account specified in the operation is the sponsored account.

[End Sponsoring Future Reserves](../start/list-of-operations.mdx#end-sponsoring-future-reserves) will end the current is-sponsoring-future-reserves-for relationship for the source account of the operation.

At the end of any transaction, there must be no ongoing is-sponsoring-future-reserves-for relationships. This is why these two operations must be used together in a single transaction.

### Revoke Sponsorship

[Revoke Sponsorship](../start/list-of-operations.mdx#revoke-sponsorship) is the third and final operation relevant to sponsorships. It allows the sponsoring account to remove/transfer sponsorships of existing ledgerEntries and signers. If the ledgerEntry/signer is not sponsored, the owner of the ledgerEntry/signer can establish a sponsorship if it is the beneficiary of a is-sponsoring-future-reserves-for relationship.

See [Revoke Sponsorship](../start/list-of-operations.mdx#revoke-sponsorship) for more information about the structure of this operation object.

#### Operation logic

- Entry/signer is sponsored
  - Source account is currently the beneficiary of a is-sponsoring-future-reserves-for relationship
    - Transfer sponsorship of entry/signer from source account to the account that is-sponsoring-future-reserves-for source account
  - Source account is not the beneficiary of a is-sponsoring-future-reserves-for relationship
    - Remove the sponsorship from the entry/signer
- Entry/signer is not sponsored
  - Source account is currently the beneficiary of a is-sponsoring-future-reserves-for relationship
    - Establish sponsorship between entry/signer and the account that is-sponsoring-future-reserves-for source account
  - Source account is not the beneficiary of a is-sponsoring-future-reserves-for relationship
    - No-Op

#### Errors

The logic above does not detail any of the error cases, which are specified [here](../start/list-of-operations.mdx#revoke-sponsorship).

## Examples
### Simple Example

In the example below, `A` is sponsoring a trustline for `B`. Notice how the `CHANGE_TRUST` operation is sandwiched between the begin and end sponsoring operations.

```
sourceAccount: B
operations[0]:
    sourceAccount: A
    body:
        type: BEGIN_SPONSORING_FUTURE_RESERVES
        sponsoredID: B
operations[1]:
    sourceAccount: B
    body:
        type: CHANGE_TRUST
        line: X
        limit: INT64_MAX
operations[2]:
    sourceAccount: B
    body:
        type: END_SPONSORING_FUTURE_RESERVES
```

### Transferring and Revoking Sponsorship
The below code uses the [Go SDK](../software-and-sdks/index.mdx) to demonstrate both the **transfer** and subsequent **revocation** of a sponsorship; refer to [CAP-0033](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/core/cap-0033.md#example-revoke-sponsorship) for more-generic pseudocode for this process.


<CodeExample>

```go
package sdk

import (
	sdk "github.com/stellar/go/clients/horizonclient"
	"github.com/stellar/go/keypair"
	"github.com/stellar/go/network"
	"github.com/stellar/go/txnbuild"
)

func revocation() {
	client := sdk.DefaultTestNetClient

	// Suppose that these accounts exist and are funded accordingly:
	A, B, C := keypair.MustRandom(), keypair.MustRandom(), keypair.MustRandom()
	sponsoredAccount := B.Address()

	// NOTE: Error checks are omitted for brevity; always check return values!

	// Load the corresponding account for both A and C.
	aAccount, err := client.AccountDetail(sdk.AccountRequest{AccountID: A.Address()})
	cAccount, err := client.AccountDetail(sdk.AccountRequest{AccountID: B.Address()})

	// We presuppose that Account B has previously been sponsored for some
	// operation by Account A (here, we refer to a `ManageData` operation).

	//
	// 1. Transfer sponsorship of B from A to C.
	//

	transferOps := []txnbuild.Operation{
		&txnbuild.BeginSponsoringFutureReserves{
			SourceAccount: &cAccount,
			SponsoredID:   sponsoredAccount,
		},
		&txnbuild.RevokeSponsorship{
			SponsorshipType: txnbuild.RevokeSponsorshipTypeData,
			Account:         &sponsoredAccount,
		},
		&txnbuild.RevokeSponsorship{
			SourceAccount:   &aAccount,
			SponsorshipType: txnbuild.RevokeSponsorshipTypeAccount,
			Account:         &sponsoredAccount,
		},
		&txnbuild.EndSponsoringFutureReserves{},
	}

	// Build, sign, and submit the transaction
	tx, err := txnbuild.NewTransaction(
		txnbuild.TransactionParams{
			SourceAccount:        &cAccount,
			IncrementSequenceNum: true,
			BaseFee:              txnbuild.MinBaseFee,
			// As always, use a real timeout in production!
			Timebounds: txnbuild.NewInfiniteTimeout(),
			Operations: transferOps,
		},
	)

	// Notice that *both* A and C have to approve the sponsorship transfer.
	tx, err = tx.Sign(network.TestNetworkPassphrase, A)
	tx, err = tx.Sign(network.TestNetworkPassphrase, C)
	client.SubmitTransaction(tx)

	//
	// 2. Revoke sponsorship of B entirely.
	//
	revokeOp := txnbuild.RevokeSponsorship{
		SponsorshipType: txnbuild.RevokeSponsorshipTypeData,
		Account:         &sponsoredAccount,
	}

	// Build, sign, and submit the transaction
	tx, err = txnbuild.NewTransaction(
		txnbuild.TransactionParams{
			SourceAccount:        &cAccount,
			IncrementSequenceNum: true,
			BaseFee:              txnbuild.MinBaseFee,
			Timebounds:           txnbuild.NewInfiniteTimeout(),
			Operations:           []txnbuild.Operation{&revokeOp},
		},
	)

	// Notice that *both* A and C have to approve the sponsorship transfer.
	tx, err = tx.Sign(network.TestNetworkPassphrase, C)
	client.SubmitTransaction(tx)
}
```
