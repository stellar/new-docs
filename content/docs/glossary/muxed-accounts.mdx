<Alert>

  **Warning**: *This feature is experimental.*
  Multiplexed accounts are not widely supported yet. Many wallets may not display a muxed account address and instead display the account ID address, ignoring the 64-bit ID. Adoption efforts are actively in progress.

</Alert>


A **multiplexed** (or **muxed**) **account** is an account that exists "on top of" a traditional Stellar account address. It combines the familiar `GABC...` address alongside a 64-bit integer ID in order to support differentiating multiple "virtual" accounts that share an underlying "real" account.

They were defined in [CAP-27](https://stellar.org/protocol/cap-27) and introduced into Stellar protocol in protocol version 13. Their string representation is described in [SEP-23](https://stellar.org/protocol/sep-21). Muxed accounts have their own address format that starts with an `M` prefix. For example, from the account address `GA7QYNF7SOWQ3GLR2BGMZEHXAVIRZA4KVWLTJJFC7MGXUA74P7UJVSGZ`, we can create two muxed accounts with different IDs:

  - `MA7QYNF7SOWQ3GLR2BGMZEHXAVIRZA4KVWLTJJFC7MGXUA74P7UJUAAAAAAAAAAAACJUQ` has the ID `0`, while 
  - `MA7QYNF7SOWQ3GLR2BGMZEHXAVIRZA4KVWLTJJFC7MGXUA74P7UJUAAAAAAAAAABUTGI4` has the ID `420`.

Both of these addresses, when used with one of the [supported operations][supported-ops], will act on the underlying `GA7Q...` address.

With muxed accounts, we can *natively* support the ecosystem-level abstraction of account memo requirements (see [SEP-29](https://stellar.org/protocol/sep-29)), where the memo was often used to distinguish between customers backed by a single custodial account. Now, the embedded ID can be used for this distinction, and guides like [this one](../building-apps/setup-custodial-account.mdx) can be made superfluous.

There are many other benefits to embedding this abstraction into the protocol:

  - **"Share-ability"**: Rather than worrying about error-prone things like transaction memo IDs, you can just share the `M...` address.
  - **SDK support**: The various [SDKs](../software-and-sdks) support this abstraction natively, letting you create, manage, and work with muxed accounts easily.
  - **extensibility**: Using 64 bits for the integer ID embedded into each muxed account ensures that most abstractions can be encoded; it can be used to represent almost anything.


<Alert>

  **Terminology Tip**: The term *multiplexing* (often contracted to *muxing*) comes from computer networking and telecommunications, where multiple signals are combined into one signal over a shared medium.
  We are doing the same thing with muxed accounts: combining multiple "virtual" accounts into a single shared account in the Stellar ledger.

</Alert>


It's worth noting that this feature is intended to be a high-level abstraction, merely embedded into the protocol for convenience and standardization. As far as the Stellar Network is concerned, all of the [supported operations][supported-ops] operate exactly as if you did not used a muxed account. For example, if you make a payment from two muxed accounts that share an underlying Stellar account (but have different IDs), this is *exactly the same* as that Stellar account sending two payments as far as the ledger is concerned.

At the end of the day, only the underlying `G...` account _truly_ exists on the ledger. 
However, the [Horizon API](../../api/introduction/) will make some effort to interpret and track the muxed accounts responsible for certain actions.


## Supported Operations

Not all operations can be used with muxed accounts. For example, you cannot pass muxed accounts to [`CreateAccount`](../start/list-of-operations.mdx#create-account), because only their shared, underlying `G...` account exists in the ledger. However, you can use them with:

  - the source account of *any* operation or [transaction](./transactions.mdx),
  - the destination of all three types of payments:
    * [`Payment`](../start/list-of-operations.mdx#payment),
    * [`PathPaymentStrictSend`](../start/list-of-operations.mdx#path-payment-strict-send), and
    * [`PathPaymentStrictReceive`](../start/list-of-operations.mdx#path-payment-strict-receive)
  - the destination of an [`AccountMerge`](../start/list-of-operations.mdx#account-merge),
  - the fee source of a [fee-bump transaction](./fee-bumps.mdx)

As is the case for most protocol-level features, you can find more usage examples and inspiration in the relevant test suite for your favorite SDK. For example, [here](https://github.com/stellar/js-stellar-base/blob/master/test/unit/muxed_account_test.js) are some of the JavaScript test cases.
