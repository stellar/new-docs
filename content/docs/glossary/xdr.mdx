**XDR**, also known as _External Data Representation_, is used throughout the
Stellar network and protocol. The ledger, transactions, results, history, and
even the messages passed between computers running stellar-core are encoded
using XDR.

XDR is specified in [RFC 4506](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4506.html) and is
similar to tools like Protocol Buffers or Thrift. XDR provides a few important
features:

- It is very compact, so it can be transmitted quickly and stored with minimal
  disk space.
- Data encoded in XDR is reliably and predictably stored. Fields are always in
  the same order, which makes cryptographically signing and verifying XDR
  messages simple.
- XDR definitions include rich descriptions of data types and structures, which
  is not possible in simpler formats like JSON, TOML, or YAML.

## Parsing XDR

Since XDR is a binary format and not as widely known as simpler formats like
JSON, the Stellar SDKs all include tools for parsing XDR and will do so
automatically when retrieving data.

In addition, the Horizon API server generally exposes the most important parts
of the XDR data in JSON, so they are easier to parse if you are not using an
SDK. The XDR data is still included (encoded as a base64 string) inside the JSON
in case you need direct access to it. .X files

Data structures in XDR are specified in an _interface definition file_ (IDL).
The IDL files used for the Stellar Network are available
[on GitHub](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-core/tree/master/src/xdr).
