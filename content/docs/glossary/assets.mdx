The Stellar distributed network can be used to track, hold, and transfer any type of **asset**: dollars, euros, bitcoin, stocks, gold, and other tokens of value. Any asset on the network can be traded and exchanged with any other using Stellar's built-in [decentralized exchange](./decentralized-exchange.mdx).

For more information on assets, see the [Anatomy of an Asset](../issuing-assets/anatomy-of-an-asset.mdx) in the [Issue Assets](../issuing-assets) section of the docs.
