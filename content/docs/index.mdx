The information here is designed to help developers build on Stellar,

https://www.stellar.org/developers/guides/



If you are looking for detailed documentation on Stellar’s HTTP API or client libraries for your favorite programming language, check out the [API Reference](../reference) section.

Some guides are grouped together:

## Get Started

The [Get Started guide](./get-started) will introduce you to the basic technical aspects of Stellar, starting with an introduction to the various parts of the Stellar network, then moving on to address programmatically creating accounts and performing transactions.

## Concepts

The Concepts section contains overviews and explanations of various objects, terms, and technologies used throughout the Stellar ecosystem, from [accounts](./concepts/accounts.md) to the details of the [Stellar Consensus Protocol](./concepts/scp.md) that underlies everything.

## SDKs

Looking for more details on Stellar’s client SDKs? You can find detailed documentation for each client SDK in the [API Reference](../reference) section.
