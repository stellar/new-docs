Right now, you're looking at the **new Stellar docs**, which are a work in progress.  These new docs will live alongside the [existing Stellar docs](https://www.stellar.org/developers/guides/) until we complete the content, do some polish passes, root out and squash any bugs in the interface, and get feedback from the SDF and the Stellar community at large.

The goal is to keep everything good from the existing docs but to streamline the navigation, improve the looks, and update the content to better reflect where things stand now.  These new docs are also more modular — they're organized around different learning paths —  and the plan is to add new paths as network use cases evolve. 

As you read through these new docs, you will likely find bugs, errors, typos, or omissions.  When you do, please file PRs or issues in this repo or make a report using [this typeform survey](https://stellarform.typeform.com/to/suEIZI)

## Issue Assets
Stellar is a multi-currency network by design.  The ability to issue assets is fundatental to Stellar, and it's something you can quickly, safrely, and in a few lines of code.  Once you've issued an asset, you can also publish canonical information about it for wallets and consumers, control access to it by settiing simple flags, and make it available for trade on the Stellar decentralized exchange.  

## Enable Deposits and Withdrawals
Many Stellar assets represent real-world currencies such as dollars, euros, or naira.  The organizations that accept deposits of those currencies — which we call **anchors** — set up standard infrastructure 

## Build Apps
Manage keys and integrate payments, trades, accounts, and assets into your app using our robust SDKs.

## Run a Core Node
Connect a computer to Stellar to store the ledger and participate in consensus.

## Run an API Server
Spin up a Horizon server to monitor, query, and submit to the network.

## Learning Resources 
### Digital Asset Stack
Understand how the Stellar node software (Core), API (Horizon), and ecosystem standards (Stellar Ecosystem Proposals, or SEPs) work together to help you issue interoperable assets.

### Ledger Entries
Study how ledgers, accounts, transactions, and operations fit together to power an open network for storing and moving money.

### Quickstart
Install your preferred SDK, create an account, and make a test API request on the testnet.

### Glossary
Learn about the building blocks of the network.
