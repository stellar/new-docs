Stellar is a peer-to-peer network made up of nodes, which are computers that
keep a common distributed [ledger](link), and that communicate to validate and
add [transactions](link) to it. Nodes use a program called Stellar Core — an
implementation of the [Stellar Consensus Protocol](link) — to stay in sync as
they work to agree on the validity of transaction sets and to apply them to the
ledger. Generally, nodes reach consensus, apply a transaction set, and update
the ledger every 3-5 seconds.

You don’t need to run a node to build on Stellar: you can start developing with
your [SDK of choice](link), and use public instances of Horizon to query the
ledger and submit transactions right away. In fact, the Stellar Development
Foundation offers two public instances of Horizon — one for the public network
and one for the testnet — which you can read more about in our
[API reference docs](link). [Lobstr](link) and [Satoshipay](link) also offer
public Horizon instances.

If you’re serious about building on Stellar, have a production-level product or
service that requires high-availability access network, or want to help increase
network health and decentralization, then you probably _do_ want to run a node,
or even a trio of nodes (more on that in the [Tier 1 section](link)). At that
point, you have a choice: you can pay a service provider like
[Blockdaemon](link) to set up and run your node for you, or you can do it
yourself.

If you’re going the DIY route, this section of the docs is for you. It explains
the technical and operational aspects of installing, configuring, and
maintaining a Stellar Core node, and should help you figure out the best way to
set up your Stellar integration.

The basic flow, which you can navigate through using the menu on the left, goes
like this:

- Choose which type of node you want to run
- Prepare Your Environment
- Install Stellar Core
- Configure Stellar Core
- Join the network
- Monitor and maintain your node
- Join the validators channels to stay on top of critical upgrades and network
  votes

## Types of nodes

All nodes perform the same basic functions: they run Stellar Core, connect to
peers, submit transactions, store the state of the ledger in a SQL
[database](link), and keep a duplicate copy of the ledger in flat XDR files
called [buckets](link). All nodes also support [Horizon](link), the Stellar API.

In addition to those basic functions, there are two key configuration options
that determine how a node behaves. A node can:

- Participate in consensus to [validate transactions](link)
- Publish an [archive](link) that other nodes can consult to find the complete
  history of the network.

To make things easier, we’ll define four types of nodes based on permutations of
those two options: **Watcher**, **Basic Validator**, **Full Validator**, and
**Archiver**. You’ll notice that they _all_ support Horizon and submit
transactions to the network:

| Type of Node        | Supports Horizon   | Submits Transactions | Validates Transactions | Publishes History  |
| ------------------- | ------------------ | -------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------ |
| **Watcher**         | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark:   |                        |                    |
| **Basic Validator** | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark:   | :heavy_check_mark:     |                    |
| **Full Validator**  | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark:   | :heavy_check_mark:     | :heavy_check_mark: |
| **Archiver**        | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark:   |                        | :heavy_check_mark: |

So why choose one type over another? Let’s break it down a bit and take a look
at what each type is good for.

### Watcher

#### Non-validating, no public archive

A Watcher is the lightest node you can run. It keeps track of the ledger and
submits transactions for possible inclusion, but it is _not_ configured to
participate in validation or to publish a history archive, which means it
doesn’t do anything to support the network or increase decentralization.

Watchers pair well with Horizon, and if all you need is a Horizon instance to
query the ledger or submit transactions, a Watcher is probably the right choice
for you. While there are public instances of Horizon you can use — namely those
maintained by [SDF](link), [Lobstr](link), and [Satoshipay](link) — they’re all
rate limited, so they won’t work if you need to scale your project or you want
to offer your customers an SLA — 99% uptime, for instance.

**Use a Watcher to run Horizon, and to ensure reliable access to the network.**

### Basic Validator

#### Validating, no public archive

A Basic Validator is a lot like a Watcher, and has the same advantages and
similar operational requirements. The difference between the two is that a Basic
Validator requires a secret key, and is
[configured to participate in consensus](link) by voting on — and signing off on
— changes to the ledger.

The advantage: signatures can serve as official endorsements of specific ledgers
in real time. That’s important if, for instance, you issue an asset on Stellar
that represents a real-world asset: you can let your customers know that you
will only honor transactions and redeem assets from ledgers signed by your
validator, and in the unlikely scenario that something happens to the network,
you can use your node as the final arbiter of truth. Setting up your node as a
validator allows you to resolve any questions _up front and in writing_ about
how you plan to deal with disasters and disputes.

**Use a Basic Validator to run Horizon, ensure reliable access to the network,
and sign off on transactions.**

### Full Validator

#### Validating, offers public archive

A Full Validator is the same as a Basic Validator except that it also publishes
a [History Archive](link) containing snapshots of the ledger, including all
transactions and their results. A Full Validator writes to an internet-facing
blob store — such as AWS or Azure — so it's a bit more expensive and complex to
run, but it also does the most to support the network’s resilience and
decentralization.

When other nodes join the network — or experience difficulty and temporarily
fall out of sync — they can consult archives offered by Full Validators to catch
up on the history of the network. Redundant archives prevent a single point of
failure, and allow network participants to verify the veracity of a given
history.

Full Validators can support Horizon, but generally, organizations that run them
don’t use them to query network data or submit transactions. In fact, they often
run a Watcher to handle Horizon _in addition_ to Full Validators. Most of those
organizations are also part of — or on track to join — [Tier 1](link), which is
a core group of network participants who run three Full Validators to contribute
maximum redundancy.

**Use a Full Validator to sign off on transactions, and to contribute to the
health and decentralization of the network.**

### Archiver

#### Non-validating, offers public archive

An Archiver is a rare bird: like a Full Validator, it publishes the activity of
the network in long-term storage; unlike a Full Validator, it does not
participate in consensus.

Archivers help with decentralization a bit by offering redundant accounts of the
network’s history, but they don’t vote or sign ledgers, so their usefulness is
fairly limited. If you run a Stellar-facing service, like a blockchain explorer,
you may want to run one. Otherwise, you’re probably better off choosing one of
the other three types.

**Use an archiver if you want to referee the network. Which is unlikely.**
