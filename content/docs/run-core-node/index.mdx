Stellar is a peer-to-peer network made up of nodes, which are computers that run a program called Stellar Core to communicate, validate transactions, and construct a chain of ledgers guaranteed to be in agreement across all participating nodes at all times.   

It explains the technical and operational aspects of installing, configuring, and maintaining a Stellar core node. 

Generally, people run a node in conjunction with the Horizon API, which allows them to easily query the ledger and submit transactions.  

You don’t need to run a node to build on Stellar: you can start developing using your [SDK of choice](link), and use public instances of Horizon to query the ledger and submit transactions.  

The Stellar Development Foundation runs two Horizon servers, one for the public network and one for the test network, free for anyone's use at https://horizon.stellar.org and https://horizon-testnet.stellar.org.  These servers are good for development and small-scale projects — most businesses building on Stellar don’t need to worry about mastering the operational requirements of running a node until after their project is off the ground — but we don’t recommend using them for production services that need strong reliability.

Basic flow:
* Choose which type of node you want to run
* Install Stellar Core
* Configure Stellar Core
* Prepare Your Environment
* Join the network
* Monitor and maintain your node
* Join the validators channels to stay on top of critical upgrades and network votes
