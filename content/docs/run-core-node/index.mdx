Stellar is a peer-to-peer network made up of nodes, which are computers that keep a common distributed [ledger](link), and that communicate to validate and add [transactions](link) to it.  Nodes use a program called Stellar Core — an implementation of the [Stellar Consensus Protocol](link) — to stay in sync as they work to agree on the validity of transaction sets and to apply them to the ledger.  Generally, nodes reach consensus, apply a transaction set, and update the ledger every 3-5 seconds.

You don’t need to run a node to build on Stellar: you can start developing with your [SDK of choice](link), and use public instances of Horizon to query the ledger and submit transactions right away.  In fact, the Stellar Development Foundation offers two public instances of Horizon — one for the public network and one for the testnet — which you can read more about in our [API reference docs](link).  [Lobstr](link) and [Satoshipay](link) also offer public Horizon instances.

If you’re serious about building on Stellar, have a production-level product or service that requires high-availability access network, or want to help increase network health and decentralization, then you probably *do* want to run a node, or even a trio of nodes (more on that in the [Tier 1 section](link)).  At that point, you have a choice: you can pay a service provider like [Blockdaemon](link) to set up and run your node for you, or you can do it yourself. 

If you’re going the DIY route, this section of the docs is for you.  It explains the technical and operational aspects of installing, configuring, and maintaining a Stellar Core node, and should help you figure out the best way to set up your Stellar integration.

The basic flow, which you can navigate through using the menu on the left, goes like this:
* Choose which type of node you want to run
* Prepare Your Environment
* Install Stellar Core
* Configure Stellar Core
* Join the network
* Monitor and maintain your node
* Join the validators channels to stay on top of critical upgrades and network votes
