Before installing Stellar Core, you will need to configure the instance hosting it roughly the same way.

## Compute Requirements
We recently asked stellar-core operators what they neededâ€¦

CPU, RAM, Disk and network depends on network activity. If you decide to collocate certain workloads, you will need to take this into account.

As of early 2018, stellar-core with PostgreSQL running on the same machine has no problem running on a [m5.large](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/m5/) in AWS (dual core 2.5 GHz Intel Xeon, 8 GB RAM).

Storage wise, 20 GB seems to be an excellent working set as it leaves plenty of room for growth.

## Network access
Stellar Core interacts with the peer-to-peer network, which means that 
  * **inbound**: stellar-core needs to allow all ips to connect to its `PEER_PORT` (default 11625) over TCP.
  * **outbound**: stellar-core needs access to connect to other peers on the internet on `PEER_PORT` (most use the default as well) over TCP.

Interaction with other internal systems
  * **outbound**:
    * stellar-core needs access to a database (postgresql for example), which may reside on a different machine on the network
    * other connections can safely be blocked
  * **inbound**: stellar-core exposes an *unauthenticated* HTTP endpoint on port `HTTP_PORT` (default 11626)
    * it is used by other systems (such as Horizon) to submit transactions (so may have to be exposed to the rest of your internal ips)
    *  query information (info, metrics, ...) for humans and automation
    *  perform administrative commands (schedule upgrades, change log levels, ...)

Note on exposing the HTTP endpoint:
if you need to expose this endpoint to other hosts in your local network, it is recommended to use an intermediate reverse proxy server to implement authentication. Don't expose the HTTP endpoint to the raw and cruel open internet.
