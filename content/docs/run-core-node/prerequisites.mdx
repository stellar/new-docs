There are several ways to install stellar-core -- Regardless of how you install stellar-core (apt, source, docker, etc), you will need to configure the instance hosting it roughly the same way.
https://github.com/stellar/stellar-core/blob/master/docs/architecture.md

## Compute requirements
We recently asked stellar-core operators what they needed…

CPU, RAM, Disk and network depends on network activity. If you decide to collocate certain workloads, you will need to take this into account.

As of early 2018, stellar-core with PostgreSQL running on the same machine has no problem running on a [m5.large](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/m5/) in AWS (dual core 2.5 GHz Intel Xeon, 8 GB RAM).

Storage wise, 20 GB seems to be an excellent working set as it leaves plenty of room for growth.

## Network access
Interaction with the peer to peer network
  * **inbound**: stellar-core needs to allow all ips to connect to its `PEER_PORT` (default 11625) over TCP.
  * **outbound**: stellar-core needs access to connect to other peers on the internet on `PEER_PORT` (most use the default as well) over TCP.

Interaction with other internal systems
  * **outbound**:
    * stellar-core needs access to a database (postgresql for example), which may reside on a different machine on the network
    * other connections can safely be blocked
  * **inbound**: stellar-core exposes an *unauthenticated* HTTP endpoint on port `HTTP_PORT` (default 11626)
    * it is used by other systems (such as Horizon) to submit transactions (so may have to be exposed to the rest of your internal ips)
    *  query information (info, metrics, ...) for humans and automation
    *  perform administrative commands (schedule upgrades, change log levels, ...)

Note on exposing the HTTP endpoint:
if you need to expose this endpoint to other hosts in your local network, it is recommended to use an intermediate reverse proxy server to implement authentication. Don't expose the HTTP endpoint to the raw and cruel open internet.
Database and local state
Something about the way stellar-core stores stuff in two ways…Stellar-core stores the state of the ledger in a SQL database.  Stellar-core stores a duplicate copy of the ledger in the form of flat XDR files  called "buckets." 

After configuring your [database](#database) and [buckets](#buckets) settings, when running stellar-core for the first time, you must initialize the database:

`$ stellar-core new-db`

This command will initialize the database as well as the bucket directory and then exit. 

You can also use this command if your DB gets corrupted and you want to restart it from scratch. 

## Database

Stellar-core stores the state of the ledger in a SQL database.
https://github.com/stellar/stellar-core/blob/master/docs/db-schema.md

This DB should either be a SQLite database or, for larger production instances, a separate PostgreSQL server.

*Note: Horizon currently depends on using PostgreSQL.*

For how to specify the database, 
see the [example config](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-core/blob/master/docs/stellar-core_example.cfg).

## Cursors and automatic maintenance
Some tables in the database act as a publishing queue for external systems such as Horizon and generate **meta data** for changes happening to the distributed ledger.

If not managed properly those tables will grow without bounds. To avoid this, a built-in scheduler will delete data from old ledgers that are not used anymore by other parts of the system (external systems included).

The settings that control the automatic maintenance behavior are: `AUTOMATIC_MAINTENANCE_PERIOD`,  `AUTOMATIC_MAINTENANCE_COUNT` and `KNOWN_CURSORS`.

By default, stellar-core will perform this automatic maintenance, so be sure to disable it until you have done the appropriate data ingestion in downstream systems (Horizon for example sometimes needs to reingest data).

If you need to regenerate the metadata, the simplest way is to replay ledgers for the range you're interested in after (optionally) clearing the database with `newdb`.

## Metadata Snapshots and Restoration
Some deployments of stellar-core and Horizon will want to retain metadata for the _entire history_ of the network. This metadata can be quite large and computationally expensive to regenerate anew by replaying ledgers in stellar-core from an empty initial database state, as described in the previous section.

This can be especially costly if run more than once. For instance, when bringing a new node online. Or even if running a single node with Horizon, having already ingested the meta data _once_: a subsequent version of Horizon may have a schema change that entails re-ingesting it _again_.

Some operators therefore prefer to shut down their stellar-core (and/or Horizon) processes and _take filesystem-level snapshots_ or _database-level dumps_ of the contents of stellar-core's database and bucket directory, and/or Horizon's database, after metadata generation has occurred the first time. Such snapshots can then be restored, putting stellar-core and/or Horizon in a state containing metadata without performing full replay.

Any reasonably-recent state will do — if such a snapshot is a little old, stellar-core will replay ledgers from whenever the snapshot was taken to the current network state anyways — but this procedure can greatly accelerate restoring validator nodes, or cloning them to create new ones.


## Buckets
Stellar-core stores a duplicate copy of the ledger in the form of flat XDR files  called "buckets." These files are placed in a directory specified in the config file as `BUCKET_DIR_PATH`, which defaults to `buckets`. The bucket files are used for hashing and transmission of ledger differences to history archives. 

Buckets should be stored on a fast local disk with sufficient space to store several times the size of the current ledger. 
 
For the most part, the contents of both directories can be ignored as they are managed by stellar-core.
