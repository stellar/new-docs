## Release version

In general you should aim to run the latest [release](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-core/releases) as builds are backward compatible and are cumulative.

The version number scheme that we follow is `protocol_version.release_number.patch_number` where:

`protocol_version` is the maximum protocol version supported by that release (all versions are 100% backward compatible),
 `release_number` is bumped when a set of new features or bug fixes not impacting the protocol are included in the release,
`patch_number` is used when a critical fix has to be deployed
Container-based installation
Docker images are maintained in a few places, good starting points are:

the [quickstart image](https://github.com/stellar/docker-stellar-core-horizon)
the [standalone image](https://github.com/stellar/docker-stellar-core). **Warning**: this only tracks the latest master, so you have to find the image based on the [release](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-core/releases) that you want to use.

## Installing from source

See the [INSTALL](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-core/blob/master/INSTALL.md) for build instructions.

## Package-based Installation
