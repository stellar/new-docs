title: Running Your Node
order: 
---
## Starting stellar-core
After having configured your node and its environment, you're ready to start stellar-core.

This can be done with a command equivalent to

`$ stellar-core run`

At this point you're ready to observe core's activity as it joins the network.

Review the [logging](#logging) section to get yourself familiar with the output of stellar-core.
Interacting with your instance
While running, interaction with stellar-core is done via an administrative HTTP endpoint. Commands can be submitted using command-line HTTP tools such as `curl`, or by running a command such as

`$ stellar-core http-command <http-command>`

The endpoint is [not intended to be exposed to the public internet](#interaction-with-other-internal-systems). It's typically accessed by administrators, or by a mid-tier application to submit transactions to the Stellar network. 

See [commands](./commands.md) for a description of the available commands.

## Joining the network
You can review the section on [general node information](#general-node-information); the node will go through the following phases as it joins the network:
Establish connection to other peers
You should see `authenticated_count` increase.

```json
"peers" : {
         "authenticated_count" : 3,
         "pending_count" : 4
      },
```

## Observing consensus

Until the node sees a quorum, it will say
```json
"state" : "Joining SCP"
```

After observing consensus, a new field `quorum` will be set with information on what the network decided on, at this point the node will switch to "*Catching up*":
```json
      "quorum" : {
         "qset" : {
            "ledger" : 22267866,
            "agree" : 5,
            "delayed" : 0,
            "disagree" : 0,
            "fail_at" : 3,
            "hash" : "980a24",
            "missing" : 0,
            "phase" : "EXTERNALIZE"
         },
         "transitive" : {
            "intersection" : true,
            "last_check_ledger" : 22267866,
            "node_count" : 21
         }
      },
      "state" : "Catching up",
```
## Catching up
This is a phase where the node downloads data from archives. The state will start with something like:
```json
      "state" : "Catching up",
      "status" : [ "Catching up: Awaiting checkpoint (ETA: 35 seconds)" ]
```

and then go through the various phases of downloading and applying state such as
```json
      "state" : "Catching up",
      "status" : [ "Catching up: downloading ledger files 20094/119803 (16%)" ]
```
## Synced
When the node is done catching up, its state will change to
```json
      "state" : "Synced!"
```

## Logging
Stellar-core sends logs to standard output and `stellar-core.log` by default, 
configurable as `LOG_FILE_PATH`.

 Log messages are classified by progressive _priority levels_:
  `TRACE`, `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARNING`, `ERROR` and `FATAL`.
   The logging system only emits those messages at or above its configured logging level. 

The log level can be controlled by configuration, the `-ll` command-line flag 
or adjusted dynamically by administrative (HTTP) commands. Run:

`$ stellar-core http-command "ll?level=debug"`

against a running system.
Log levels can also be adjusted on a partition-by-partition basis through the 
administrative interface.
 For example the history system can be set to DEBUG-level logging by running:

`$ stellar-core http-command "ll?level=debug&partition=history"` 

against a running system.
 The default log level is `INFO`, which is moderately verbose and should emit 
 progress messages every few seconds under normal operation.
