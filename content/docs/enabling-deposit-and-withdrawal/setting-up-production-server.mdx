title: Setting Up a Production Server
order: 40
---

Once the test server is live and you have tested both deposit and withdraw flows, it's time to get started with the real deploy connected to real KYC and real banking rails providers. Before using any banking APIs, it's critical that you perform a full security audit on the system to make sure that there aren't any security vulnerabilities.

## Deploying a Secure Environment
Make sure to keep the test server up, and deploy the production (mainnet) system in a separate environment. Having two deploys allows you to validate new features on the tesnet before moving them to the final production deploy. You can also have a third staging environment if there's a big team working on this codebase and/or there will be many pushes to be tested internally before sharing with other institutions.

To switch to Stellar's public (mainnet) network, all you have to do is change the network [passphrase](link) (for authenticating requests) and [Horizon URL](link). Stellar SDKs have all the built-in logic to switch from test to public with minor changes to the codebase.

Before distributing real assets on the public network, make sure you follow [best practices for asset issuance](link) by creating a distribution account that is separate from the issuing account. The issuing account secret key should be highly secured via means such as cold storage or multi-signature, and should only be used to send (and, consequently, issue) assets to the distribution account. The distribution account will be used by your server to send (and receive) assets to the users programmatically.

Since the distribution account will be managed programmatically, it should only have a balance necessary to keep operations running for a short period of time. The issuing account should send small amounts of an asset to the distribution account frequently to represent the expected deposit volume for a given period. You should set up the transfer from the issuing account to the distribution account once day, or once a week week, to make sure the distribution account only has the minimum necessary balance to keep the operation functional in that short period.

## Connecting to Real KYC
Most issuers of fiat-backed assets need to collect  [KYC](link) (Know Your Customer) information to comply with local regulations before honoring deposits and withdrawals. The KYC flow usually consists of a simple form that gathers relevant information about the user, such as name, email, address, age, and government-issued ID number.

How you handle KYC is up to you: there are many services that provide KYC solutions through APIs and iFrames, and that validate the input data and sync with governmental databases to verify requirements. Each jurisdiction has specific KYC requirements, and they differ from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, so it's best to find a country-specific KYC provider that meets your needs.

Some countries require different KYC fields depending on the amount to be deposited or withdrawn. If that's the case in your jurisdiction and you need to adapt your KYC forms based on the deposit or withdrawal amount, simply add an amount field before the KYC form, and make sure that the KYC fields are updated based on that value.

KYC information should be linked to the session created through [Stellar Web Authentication](link) and, consequently, to the user, so you only need to ask the user for it once. After the first KYC flow is complete, a user shouldn't have to input the information again.

Make sure the errors and validation messages are clear and include instructions for what to do next to ensure a good user experience and increase the KYC conversion rate. You should also localize messages based on the user's language and location.

## Connecting to Real Banking Rails
Issuers of fiat-backed tokens on Stellar are expected to manage a full reserve.  That means there's a 1:1 relationship between Stellar-network tokens and money in the bank.  Since each fiat token on Stellar is backed by, and can be redeemed for, an underlying, real-world asset, issuers of fiat-backed tokens need to connect to real banking rails to validate user deposits (through bank transfers, credit card payments, etc.) and to complete user withdrawals (generally through bank transfers).

In order to fetch (and identify) a user transfer, issuers usually take one of two approaches:

* API Polling: this option consists of fetching the bank's API, through a cron job, to check for the updated status of the list of transfers received by (and sent from) the issuer's bank account. Once the system confirms a new transaction and identifies that it relates to a specific deposit, it can send the digital funds to that user's account
* Webhook: not all banking rails support this option, but it's the leanest in terms of back-end logic. In this approach, the bank proactively hits an issuer's endpoint once it receives a new transfer, updating that information on the issuer's database. The issuer can then can match that transaction to an existing in-process deposit, and validate that user can receive their digital funds

There are many ways to identify that a specific bank transfer relates to a specific deposit (and, consequently, to a user). Some banks (and countries) have transfer infrastructure that allows the creation of a single bank account per transfer; others require users to add an identification parameter to their transfers.  Some banks provide the user ID number in the transaction information so issuers can match that with the information provided in the KYC form.

Make sure to do a full security audit on your systems when banking rails connections are in place. Some banks provide a testing API that can be used for development and deployment to testnet or staging environments, which means you can test and audit the codebase before moving to a final production-ready bank integration. For better security, some issuers also prefer to add a manual final step before approving withdrawal transfers. In terms of UX, this manual approval is acceptable as long as the wait times align with user expectations, which usually means they aren't longer than a couple of hours. 

## Testing Edge Cases
Once your application is fully functional, it's a good idea to test different scenarios and edge cases to make sure the system is behaving as expected. Here's a list of testing suggestions that should cover a large amount of the application's edge cases:

### General Tests
* Check to make sure the interactive interface follows our [UX Guidelines](link)
* Test the interactive flow usability on really small and really large screens
* Check that the issuing account is set up with the correct home domain, and that the website on that home domain conforms to our [Website Requirements](link)
* Test the interface using different locale information, and check for translated content including error messages, responses, date formatting, and number formatting

### KYC Tests
* Check that KYC appears with a new wallet SK
* Check that KYC (and email, if it's being used to identify users) is not appearing when using a previous wallet SK
* Check that KYC doesn't accept incorrectly formatted inputs, and that the error messages are comprehensible
* Check that you can use the same KYC information (email, phone number, username, etc) multiple times
* Check that you can go through KYC multiple times with the same Stellar SK.

### Deposit Test
* Check that deposits are disabled for really small and really large values
* Check that the deposit flow goes through, and that the banking rails are working
* Check that the endpoint returns an error if the JWT token is missing
* Check that all deposit response params conform to [protocols](link)

### Withdraw Tests
* Check that withdrawals are disabled for really small and really large values
* Check that you cannot make a withdrawal with a value higher than the current balance
* Check that the withdraw flow goes through, and that the banking rails are working
* Check that  the endpoint returns an error if the JWT token is missing
* Check that all deposit withdraw params conform to [protocols](link)

### Transaction(s) Tests
* Check that the `/transaction` endpoint is working for a newly created transaction
* Check that the `/transaction` endpoint is working for a completed transaction
* Check that the `/transactions` endpoint returns all transactions from a specific user

### Security Tests
* Ensure distribution is done through a dedicated distribution account (not the issuing account)
* Ensure market making is done through a dedicated account (not the issuing account)
* Make sure all authenticated endpoints are not accessible without the JWT tokens
