Supporting cross-border payments of an asset through the Stellar network requires cooperation between a sending anchor (**SA**) and receiving anchor (**RA**). In this section, we'll only go over the steps necessary for building a SEP-31 receiving anchor, but documentation for building a sending anchor is in development.

Specifically, we will go over the SDF's [Tools and References](./reference-implementations.mdx) as well as all three stages of the development process:

1. [Setting up a test server](./setting-up-test-server.mdx)
1. [Setting up a production server](./setting-up-production-server.mdx)
1. [Launching](./launch.mdx)

## The Basic User Experience

Unlike with SEP-24, SEP-31 involves a sending user (**SU**) and receiving user (**RU**), so both users' experience is described here.

<Alert>


Note: **SA**'s are not necessarily wallet applications. This means the **SU** may not interact with a mobile application, but could go to a website or physical remittance location instead. Obviously, this affects the **SU** experience.

</Alert>


Generally, the experience of the SU and RU would look something like this:

1. The **SU** opens an app, website, or goes to a physical remittance location
1. The **SU** specifies the asset and amount to send, and the asset that should be received
1. The **SA** finds the appropriate **RA** for the asset, authenticates with the **RA**, and parses the **RA**'s requirements for sending payments
1. The **SA** collects both the **SU** and **RU** KYC information requested by the **RA** from the **SU**, as well as the transaction information
   - **RU**'s should not have to take any action to receive a cross-border payment
   - However, it is possible to require action from the **RU** if absolutely necessary
1. The **SA** registers the **RU** and potentially **SU** with the **RA** via [SEP-12](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/ecosystem/sep-0012.md)
1. Once the **RA** is ready to receive the payment, the **SA** makes the Stellar path payment to the **RA** using the **SU** and **RU** assets
1. Once the **RA** receives the path payment, it attempts make the associated off-chain transfer (usually bank transfer) using the KYC and transaction information sent by the **SA**
1. If the transfer to the **RU** fails, the **SU** will be notified by the **SA** to update the invalid or missing fields, and the **RA** will retry once the **SA** sends the updated info.

The **RU** should then receive the funds sent by the **SA** once the **RA** has the necessary to make the final transfer.

<Alert>


Note: The final off-chain transfer by the **RA** may not be a bank transfer. For example, the destination could be a mobile money account managed by the **RA**. The methods used to transfer the payment off-chain to the **RU** is up to the **RA**, and **SA**s should be aware of the off-chain transfer methods of their partner **RA**s.

## Interoperability and Stellar Ecosystem Proposals

As mentioned, this section will outline how to implement a [SEP-31](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/ecosystem/sep-0031.md) receiver, but these servers require [SEP-1](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/ecosystem/sep-0001.md), [10](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/ecosystem/sep-0010.md), and [12](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/ecosystem/sep-0012.md) to be implemented as well. SEP-1 is described in [this guide](../../issuing-assets/publishing-asset-info.mdx), and SEP-10 & 12 are described here.
