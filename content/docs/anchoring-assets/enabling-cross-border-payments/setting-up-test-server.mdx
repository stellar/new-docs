# Build a SEP-31 Anchor on Testnet

import { CodeExample } from "components/CodeExample"; import { Alert } from "components/Alert";

Before setting up a server that connects to live banking rails and real money, you should build out a test rig connected to the [Stellar test network](../../glossary/testnet.mdx). The testnet works just like the main Stellar network, but it uses test data and allows you to fund test accounts for free using a tool called [Friendbot](../../glossary/testnet.mdx#friendbot).

Note: the testnet is reset every three months, so when building on it, make sure you have a plan to recreate necessary accounts and other data. For more info, check out the [best practices for using the testnet](../../glossary/testnet.mdx#best-practices-for-using-testnet).

At the end of this section, you should have a sandboxed system capable of interfacing with the Stellar testnet that you can easily convert into a production-ready deployment on the main Stellar network. You should always keep a testnet deployment up and running — even once you have a production version — so that wallets can test your implementation without the risk of losing real user funds.

You can also find an outline of the basic steps anchors need to complete in the [intro to SEP-31](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/ecosystem/sep-0031.md#payment-flow) section of the cross-border payment standard.

### Prerequisites

Before you start building infrastructure to connect a Stellar-network token to banking rails, you need to:

1. Issue an asset on the network – which you can find out how to do in the [Issue Assets](../../issuing-assets/index.mdx) section — or find another trustworthy issuer and coordinate with them to broker their asset.
2. Add meta-information about the asset (if you issue one) and define the location of your `DIRECT_PAYMENT_SERVER` in your `stellar.toml` so that wallets know where to find the server and relevant endpoints. You can consult [this guide](../../issuing-assets/index.mdx) for help completing your `stellar.toml`.

Once you've taken those steps, you're ready to implement an `/info` endpoint.

### Implementing the `/info` Endpoint

The `/info` endpoint allows receiving anchors to communicate basic information to sending anchors, exchange interfaces, and other Stellar apps. It responds to client queries with a JSON object detailing which currencies the anchor supports and specifically what pieces of information are required for the sender to collect and provide to the receiver in future requests.

For example, the SDF's reference server has the following `/info` response:

```json
{
  "receive": {
    "SRT": {
      "enabled": true,
      "min_amount": 10.0,
      "max_amount": 10000.0,
      "sender_sep12_type": "sep31-sender",
      "receiver_sep12_type": "sep31-receiver",
      "fee_fixed": 1.0,
      "fee_percent": 0.01,
      "fields": {
        "transaction": {
          "routing_number": {
            "description": "routing number of the destination bank account"
          },
          "account_number": {
            "description": "bank account number of the destination"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

It has a single `SRT` asset enabled with minimum and maximum amounts and both fixed rate and percetage fees taken from the amount received. If the receiving anchor has a complex fee structure that can't be expressed with the fee attributes from `/info`, sending anchors can support a `/fee` endpoint. Unfortunately, this endpoint is a pending change to the SEP that has not yet been approved. An update will be made when the `/fee` endpoint specification is finalized.

The `sender_sep12_type` and `receiver_sep12_type` keys signal to the to the **SA** application that [SEP-12](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/ecosystem/sep-0012.md) customer registration is required for both the **SU** and **RU**. The values of these attributes are the values the **SA** should include in the `GET /customer?type=<SEP-12 type value>` request for each user. In this context, users are synonymous with customers.

The `fields` object contains the single `transaction` key-value pair, which contains the custom fields the **RA** requires from the **SA**. Typically, these attributes are off-chain rails-related attributes like routing and banking numbers. **SA**s should be aware of their partner **RA**'s `fields.transaction` required attributes and should ideally validate the collected information from the **SU** prior to making the `POST /transaction` API call on the **RA**'s server.

Note: Generally, **RA**s should require the KYC fields of the **SU** and **RU** to be sent via SEP-12 and per-transaction information via SEP-31's `POST /transaction` endpoint in the `forms.transactions` object. Be aware that **SU**s must be able to understand what fields to collect for your service and ideally how to validate. Vauge descriptions or poorly named attributes will cause confusion.

### Authentication

Stellar Web Authentication ([SEP-10](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/ecosystem/sep-0010.md)) is a protocol for verifying that a user controls a Stellar private key for a given account, and for creating a persistent session for that user. It relies on a variation of mutual challenge-response, and uses Stellar transactions to encode challenges and responses: the auth server provides a 'challenge' transaction; the client signs it on behalf of the user and returns it to the anchor; the anchor checks that the signature is valid, and if it is, issues a JWT.

In the context of SEP-31, the client _and_ key holder is the sending anchor (**SA**). Receiving anchors (**RA**s) should have a list of approved sending anchors and their public keys used in SEP-10 authentication. If an authentication request is made with an unknown Stellar public key address, the receiving anchor should reject the request.

Once received, the JWT then acts as a reusable key for the **SA** to perform an action on behalf of a **SU**. It can contain an arbitrary amount of information, and is signed by the provider — in this case the asset anchor — to ensure validity.

#### Requesting a Challenge

To start the authentication flow, the client requests a challenge, which is a Stellar transaction with the sequence number set to 0. A transaction with a sequence number of 0 is, by definition, invalid, so it can't actually be submitted to the network. The issuer can, however, verify that the transaction is signed correctly (which is what happens in the next step).

The only information needed to request a challenge is the client's public key, passed as the `account` parameter. Here's an example: `GET <AUTH_ENDPOINT>?account=GXXXXXX`

#### Exchanging the Signed Challenge

Once the client signs the challenge transaction on behalf of the user using standard [Stellar SDK tools](../../software-and-sdks/index.mdx), it sends the signed transaction back to the provider. Using those same Stellar SDKs, the provider then checks to see if the transaction is properly signed, and if it is, offers the client a JWT.

This JWT should be created with the claims that are appropriate given the account that signed the challenge. It can be created with any existing JWT library.

Here are the fields included in the JWT:

* The `sub` key contains the account of the authenticated user
* The `exp` key contains the expiration of the JWT. Some JWTs should be short-lived if the claims inside of it are expected to change, or if the JWT is used in less secure environments
* Other keys can contain any type of claim or data the Anchor wishes.

Since the `sub` field contains the address of the authenticated user, it's kind of like a username. The JWT authenticates said user.

Since some tokens are used in less secure environments, such as as query parameters in URLs, you may want to create a short-lived or one-time use token to prevent a JWT from falling into the wrong hands.

### Customer Registration

Once you have implemented an `/info` endpoint and set up SEP-10 authentication, your next step is to build out [SEP-12](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/ecosystem/sep-0012.md). This SEP is a standard for communicating user KYC information between clients and servers running Stellar services.

In the context of SEP-31, the **SA** collects the information the **RA** specifies as required in the response to `GET /customer?type=<sender/receiver SEP-12 type from /info>` and makes a `PUT /customer` request containing that information back to the **RA**.

SEP-12 uses the standardized fields defined in [SEP-9](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/ecosystem/sep-0009.md), so **SA**s should be familiar with the descriptions and formats of the fields used by the **RA**.

On testnet, KYC validation is discouraged in order to lower the barrier for other to test your service. However, if information passed to an **RA** turns out to be invalid after attempting to validate it on mainnet, specific customers (**SU**s or **RU**s) can be placed in a `pending_customer_info_update` status.

This signals to the **SA** that the fields should be updated by the **SU** and resent. The problematic fields can be identified using the `GET /customer?id=<customer ID returned from the initial PUT call>` API call. These fields should be included in the future `PUT /customer` request.

**RA**s should also respect the `DELETE /customer` requests made by the **SA**.

Note: Ideally, **RA**s validate KYC data passed by **SA**s during the request/response cycle instead of reporting KYC issues via the transaction's status later in the process.

**SA**s should poll the `GET /transactions/:id` endpoint(s) provided by their partner **RA**(s) and ensure the transactions initiated are always carried out to completion by fetching updated info from the **SU** when necessary.

The two diagram below outline a potential flow between a **SA** and **RA** including all possible SEP-12 states:

```
sequenceDiagram
    participant SU
    participant SA Client
    participant RA Server
    note right of SA Client: After SEP-10 auth
    SA Client->>RA Server: [SEP-31 GET /info]
    activate RA Server
    RA Server-->>SA Client: sender_sep12_type, receiver_sep12_type
    deactivate RA Server
    SA Client->>RA Server: [SEP-12 GET /customer?type={sender_sep12_type value}]
    activate RA Server
    RA Server-->>SA Client: NEEDS_INFO, fields
    deactivate RA Server
    SA Client->>RA Server: [SEP-12 GET /customer?type={receiver_sep12_type value}]
    activate RA Server
    RA Server-->>SA Client: NEEDS_INFO, fields
    deactivate RA Server
    SA Client->>SU: Requests fields returned from [SEP-12 GET]s
    activate SU
    SU-->>SA Client: Provides field values
    deactivate SU
    note right of SA Client: Register SU KYC
    SA Client->>RA Server: [SEP-12 PUT /customer]
    activate RA Server
    RA Server-->>SA Client: ID, 202 Accepted
    deactivate RA Server
    note right of SA Client: Register RU KYC
    SA Client->>RA Server: [SEP-12 PUT /customer]
    activate RA Server
    RA Server-->>SA Client: 400 Bad Request
    deactivate RA Server
    SA Client->>SU: Requests field(s) returned from [SEP-12 GET receiver]
    activate SU
    SU-->>SA Client: Provides field values
    deactivate SU
    note right of SA Client: Retry RU registration
    SA Client->>RA Server: [SEP-12 PUT /customer]
    activate RA Server
    RA Server-->>SA Client: ID, 202 Accepted
    deactivate RA Server
```

Now that both the **SU** and **RU** are registered with the **RA**, the **SA** must initiate the transaction request with the **RA**. This process is described in the section below. Assuming the **SA** made a successful `POST /transaction` request after collecting the KYC and transaction info, a potential update-flow could look something this:

```
sequenceDiagram
    participant SU
    participant SA Client
    participant RA Server
    participant RU
    note right of RA Server: After [SEP-31 POST /transaction]
    RA Server->>RU: [SEP-31 off-chain transfer attempt]
    activate RU
    RU-->>RA Server: transfer failed due to KYC field X, Y
    deactivate RU
    note right of SA Client: After failed transfer attempt
    SA Client->>RA Server: [SEP-31 GET /transaction/:id]
    activate RA Server
    RA Server-->>SA Client: receiver pending_customer_info_update
    deactivate RA Server
    SA Client->>RA Server: [SEP-12 GET /customer?id={receiver ID}]
    activate RA Server
    RA Server-->>SA Client: NEEDS_INFO, fields
    deactivate RA Server
    SA Client->>SU: Requests updated field values
    activate SU
    SU-->>SA Client: Provides updated values
    deactivate SU
    SA Client->>RA Server: [SEP-12 PUT /customer]
    activate RA Server
    RA Server-->>SA Client: ID, 202 Accepted
    deactivate RA Server
    RA Server->>RU: [SEP-31 off-chain transfer retry]
    activate RU
    RU-->>RA Server: transfer successful!
    note right of SA Client: Detect success & notify SU
    SA Client->>RA Server: [SEP-31 GET /transactions/:id]
    activate RA Server
    RA Server-->>SA Client: completed
    deactivate RA Server
    SA Client->>SU: transfer successful!
```

\


Note: It is perfectly acceptable for **RA**s to only require KYC information on the **RU**. To do this, simply omit the `sender_sep12_type` key from the `GET /info` response. This signals to the **SA** to make one `GET` and `PUT` for receiver fields and registration, respectively.

### Transaction Processing

After registering the receiving and potentially sending user, _but prior to any update flow_, the **SA** must initiate the transaction creation process by making a `POST /transactions` request including the `receiver_id` (and `sender_id`) as well as the `fields.transaction` object containing the per-transaction level fields defined by the **RA** in `/info`.

On a successful response, the **SA** then makes the path payment on Stellar between the deposited asset from the **SU** to the asset anchored by **RA**. The transaction _must_ contain a memo of type `stellar_memo_type` with a value of `stellar_memo`. These attributes are returned in the **RA**'s `POST /transactions` response.

Note: the payment transaction _can_ be a normal strict-receive payment transaction instead of a path payment. Typically, cross-border payments will involve a cross-currency transaction.

The **RA** should be polling or streaming incoming payment transactions on their Stellar distribution account. Once detected and matched with the transaction record created by the **SA**'s `POST /transactions` request, the **RA** will attempt to transfer the value received off-chain to the associated **RU**.

The following diagram outlines the process for a successful transaction initiation request and an update flow that differs from the SEP-12 `pending_customer_info_update` process. Most of the time, **SA**s will not have to collect and provide updated transaction information. This is only in the case of data entry error by the **SU**.

Note: If the **SU** and **RU** are already registered, only the per-transaction information defined in the `GET /info` `forms.transaction` object needs to be collected. If SEP-12 registration has not happened or an update is required, it is recommended to collect both KYC and per-transaction field values from the **SU** at the same time.

\


Due to the separate documentation sections outlining the KYC and transaction API calls, we'll ask the **SU** for information a second time for per-transaction attributes.

#### Transactions Endpoint

As demonstrated in the diagram from the previous section, the `/transactions` endpoint provides a way for **SA**s to initiate (`POST`), poll (`GET :id`), and update (`PATCH :id`) transactions with an **RA**.

Check out the [SEP-31 standard](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/ecosystem/sep-0031.md) for the API request and response specifications for the `/transactions` endpoint.

### Streaming Incoming Path Payments

Receving anchors (**RA**s) must be able to detect and match incoming Stellar path payment transactions with receiving users. This can be done one of two ways:

* Polling: this option consists of periodically fetching the transactions submitted _after_ an already-seen transaction's `paging_id` that should be updated after each iteration.
* Streaming: this option consists of maintaining a persistent process that streams incoming transactions from the anchored asset's distribution account, which allows detection and transaction matching in close to real time.

For more information on path payment transactions, checkout the [operation definition](https://developers.stellar.org/api/resources/operations/object/path-payment-strict-receive/).
