title: Docs Specimen Page
---

This is the docs specimen page. Ideally, it will help ensure we implement
everything we need to implement.

# Errant H1 Tag

## H2 Tag that Follows an H1

It's pretty typical for docs start with writing like this and to have a lot of
words. So a primary goal here: make sure the page looks good with a lot of
words. For instance:

In Stellar, an asset is really just a credit from a particular account. When you
trade US dollars on the Stellar network, you don’t actually trade US dollars—you
trade US dollars _credited from a particular account._ Often, that account will
be a bank, but if your neighbor had a banana plant, they might issue banana
assets that you could trade with other people.

## This is a main point

### Here's where I elaborate

After that little bit of text, I actually start writing more about that main
point under this h3. I'm explaining more about that main point, and it should be
clear that what I'm saying now is nested under that main point. I've got a few
things I want to highlight about it, and this is just the first of those thing.

### Here's where I elaborate more

I'm going to try to give an example here of the things get used in docs,
starting with this unordered list of common markdown:

- Paragraph and headings (h1, h2, h3)
- Unordered lists
  - Unordered lists with nesting
    - Unordered lists with second-level nesting
    - Another point so we can see how that looks.
- Ordered lists
  - Which we'll look at below
- Tables
- Inline code
  - Code blocks
  - Another point so we can see how that looks
- Block Quotes
- Definition lists
- Line break
- Images
  - Images with a caption

## This is the second main point

I'm going to start pulling examples from docs at this point to illustrate some
of these needs. First, a table. I have a feeling these are going to be pretty
common.

| Field                   | Requirements           | Description                                                                                                                 |

Now we'll add a big chunk of text because, like I said, these docs tend to be
fairly text heavy.

To issue a new type of asset, all you need to do is choose a code. It can be any
combination of up to 12 letters or numbers, but you should use the appropriate
[ISO 4217 code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217) (e.g. `USD` for US
dollars). Once you’ve chosen a code, you can begin paying people using that
asset code. You don’t need to do anything to declare your asset on the network.

However, other people can’t receive your asset until they’ve chosen to trust it.
Because a Stellar asset is really a credit, you should trust that the issuer can
redeem that credit if necessary later on. You might not want to trust your
neighbor to issue banana assets if they don’t even have a banana plant, for
example.

An account can create a _trustline,_ or a declaration that it trusts a
particular asset, using the
[change trust operation](concepts/list-of-operations.md#change-trust). A
trustline can also be limited to a particular amount. If your banana-growing
neighbor only has a few plants, you might not want to trust them for more than
about 200 bananas.

Once you’ve chosen an asset code and someone else has created a trustline for
your asset, you’re free to start making payment operations to them using your
asset. If someone you want to pay doesn’t trust your asset, you might also be
able to use the [distributed exchange](concepts/exchange.md).

### More on that: a short code example

Here's a short code example:

<code-example name="Representing Assets">

```js
var astroDollar = new StellarSdk.Asset(
  "AstroDollar",
  "GC2BKLYOOYPDEFJKLKY6FNNRQMGFLVHJKQRGNSSRRGSMPGF32LHCQVGF",
);
```

```java
KeyPair issuer = StellarSdk.Keypair.fromAccountId(
  "GC2BKLYOOYPDEFJKLKY6FNNRQMGFLVHJKQRGNSSRRGSMPGF32LHCQVGF");
Asset astroDollar = Asset.createNonNativeAsset("AstroDollar", issuer);
```

### More on that: a longer code example

</code-example>
Here’s a longer example in Javascript, Java, and Go:

<code-example name="Send Custom Assets">

```js

var receivingKeys = StellarSdk.Keypair.fromSecret(
  "SDSAVCRE5JRAI7UFAVLE5IMIZRD6N6WOJUWKY4GFN34LOBEEUS4W2T2D",

// Create an object to represent the new asset

</code-example>

## This is the third point

Another thing that will be fairly common: block quotes. Short stuff gets
`this treatment`. Longer stuff will end up looking like this:

```toml
# stellar.toml example asset
[[CURRENCIES]]
code="GOAT"
issuer="GD5T6IPRNCKFOHQWT264YPKOZAWUMMZOLZBJ6BNQMUGPWGRLBK3U7ZNP"
display_decimals=2
name="goat share"
desc="1 GOAT token entitles you to a share of revenue from Elkins Goat Farm."
conditions="There will only ever be 10,000 GOAT tokens in existence. We will distribute the revenue share annually on Jan. 15th"
image="https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/666921221410439168/iriHah4f.jpg"
```

### Elaborating on the third point

Again, there's going to be some text for looks. This time, we'll also try out an
ordered list.

Accounts have [several flags](concepts/accounts.md#flags) related to issuing
assets.

If you’d like to control who can be paid with your asset, or if your asset has
some special purpose requiring sign-off from you, use the
[`AUTHORIZATION REQUIRED` flag](concepts/assets.md#controlling-asset-holders),
which requires that the issuing account also approves a trustline before the
receiving account is allowed to be paid with the asset.

[`AUTHORIZATION REVOCABLE` flag](concepts/assets.md#controlling-asset-holders)
allows you to freeze assets you issued in case of theft or other special
circumstances. This can be useful for national currencies, but is not always
applicable to other kinds of assets.

For most cases, you should avoid setting `AUTHORIZATION REVOCABLE` on your
asset. In the past, some issuers have used the `AUTHORIZATION REVOCABLE` flag in
order to impose lock-up periods. However, this is a problematic mechanism
because it does not provide the user any guarantees with regard to when or if
the assets will be unlocked.

More importantly though, _it requires a lot of effort to undo once it has been
set_. This is because if `AUTHORIZATION REVOCABLE` or `AUTHORIZATION REQUIRED`
is disabled on an asset, it has no effect on existing user accounts. In order to
be able to send your asset to existing accounts after these flags have been
turned off, you will still need to run the
[`Allow Trust`](concepts/list-of-operations.md#allow-trust) operation for each
existing user account. This requires creating a transaction with the following
operations for _every_ existing user account:

1. [`Set Options`](concepts/list-of-operations.md#set-options) to set the flags
   on the issuing account to `0x1` to enable `AUTHORIZATION REQUIRED`. This is
   necessary because you cannot run the
   [`Allow Trust`](concepts/list-of-operations.md#allow-trust) operation without
   `AUTHORIZATION REQUIRED` being set on your issuing account.
1. [`Allow Trust`](concepts/list-of-operations.md#allow-trust) on the existing
   user's account in order to authorize it. **Note:** You can actually place as
   many as `MAX OPERATIONS PER TRANSACTION - 2` (currently the
   [maximum is 100](concepts/transactions.md#list-of-operations)) `Allow Trust`
   operations for different accounts to minimize the number of transactions
   submitted to the network.
1. [`Set Options`](concepts/list-of-operations.md#set-options) to set the flags
   on the issuing account to `0x0` to disable `AUTHORIZATION REQUIRED`.
   1. If I had more points to make about `Set Options`, I'd start listing those
      here.
   1. But the truth is, we've already covered it pretty well above.
      1. Do we need to cover second-level nesting here?
      1. Probably, though I am not a fan of it most of the time
      1. It feels pretty complicated, and my brain can't process the lower
         levels
   1. I just can't figure out how they relate to top level, two levels up. Not
      without some thought, at least.

**There would probably be some text here for emphasis.** I'm putting some to see
how it looks. Imagine the above list needed some kind of poignant conclusion.
This is that.

### Yet more on that third point

When a user would like to redeem their asset off of the Stellar Network (such as
receiving cold, hard cash for an asset representing a physical currency), the
process takes places in two steps:

1. On the Stellar Network, the holder of the asset (i.e. the account with the
   trustline for the asset) sends funds back to the issuing account via a
   [Payment operation](./concepts/list-of-operations.md#payment).
1. Outside of the network, the Asset issuer provides liquidity, such as handing
   over cash at a cashier or ATM.

It's of note that when tokens are sent back to the issuing (original source)
account, they are removed from the global supply of tokens. As an asset issuer
you may not want this behavior, and you can instead establish a distribution
account which establishes the first trustline with the issuing account. This has
the benefit of also setting an initial monetary supply for your asset, and
doesn't cause your asset's monetary supply to grow or shrink each time that
payments are sent from or to the issuing account, respectively.

Regardless of which strategy you use for managing your token's supply, as an
asset issuer it is very important to make it clear to asset holders to send the
asset back to a specified account of yours, and to provide information on how
and when you will provide liquidity upon redemption.

## Final Point

There are a few outstanding assets that we need to include, and I'm putting them
here for now. This section will require a little bit of work before it's useful.

### Images

Not sure how we're handling images for this specimen since there's no folder to
put them in.

They would take this form: "![image alt text](assets/image-file-name.png)"

But I don't have an image uploaded yet, so this needs work.

### Diagrams

We're using Mermaid for diagrams, and I think they'll be pretty useful moving
forward, especially as we try to describe how various SEP flows work. I'm not
sure what we need to do to enable Mermaid, and what I'm attempting isn't
rendering correctly in my gist.

That said, here's an attempt to create one of those diagrams using Mermaid:
sequenceDiagram participant Wallet participant Anchor participant Anchor webapp

There will be a newsletter signup at the bottom, I think. Putting it here so we
can take a look.
