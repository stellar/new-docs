title: Streaming
order: 4

Horizon provides a streaming mechanism for receiving events in near real time.
Instead of repeatedly sending requests to Horizon for batch updates, a
connection is established between a client and Horizon with updates to an
endpoint response streaming as new ledgers close and updates occur.

This reduces requests that return no data and allows near instantaneous updates
client-side.

All attributes for the endpoints that allow streaming are the same as regular
responses. A caller can initiate streaming by setting ‘Accept:
text/event-stream’ in the HTTP header when making the request. Study an example
of using streaming in the
[Follow Received Payments tutorial](../../tutorials/follow-received-payments.mdx).
