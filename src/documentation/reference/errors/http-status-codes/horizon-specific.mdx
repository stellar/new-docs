These responses are specific to how a Horizon server is set up and how
transactions should be formed.

- STATUS CODE
  - VALUE
  - DESCRIPTION
- Transaction Failed
  - 400
  - The transaction_failed error occurs when a client submits a transaction that
    was well-formed but was not included in the ledger due to some other
    failure. For example, a transaction may fail if: 1) the source account for
    transaction cannot pay the minimum fee, 2) the sequence number is incorrect,
    or 3) one of the contained operations has failed such as a payment operation
    that overdraws on the paying account. In almost every case, this error
    indicates that the transaction submitted in the initial request will never
    succeed. There is one exception: a transaction that fails with the
    tx_bad_seq result code (as expressed in the result_code field of the error)
    may become valid in the future if the sequence number it used was too high.
- Transaction Malformed
  - 400
  - When you submit a malformed transaction to Horizon, Horizon will return a
    transaction_malformed error. There are many ways in which a transaction
    could be malformed, including: 1) you submitted an empty string, 2) your
    base64-encoded string is invalid, 3) your XDR structure is invalid, or 4)
    you have leftover bytes in your XDR structure.
- Before History
  - 404
  - A horizon server may be configured to only keep a portion of the stellar
    network’s history stored within its database. This error will be returned
    when a client requests a piece of information (such as a page of
    transactions or a single operation) that the server can positively identify
    as falling outside the range of recorded history.
- Stale History
  - 404
  - A horizon server may be configured to reject historical requests when the
    history is known to be further out of date than the configured threshold. In
    such cases, this error is returned. To resolve this error (provided you are
    the horizon instance’s operator) please ensure that the ingestion system is
    running correctly and importing new ledgers.
- Timeout
  - 406
  - If you are encountering this error it means that either: 1) Horizon has not
    received a confirmation from the Stellar Core server that the transaction
    you are trying to submit to the network was included in a ledger in a timely
    manner, or 2) Horizon has not sent a response to a reverse-proxy before a
    specified amount of time has elapsed. The former case may happen because
    there was no room for your transaction for 3 consecutive ledgers. This is
    because Stellar Core removes each submitted transaction from a queue. To
    solve this you can: 1) keep resubmitting the same transaction (with the same
    sequence number) and wait until it finally is added to a new ledger, or 2)
    increase the fee in order to prioritize the transaction.
