After processing a request, Horizon returns a success or error response to the
client. A success response will return a Status Code of 200, and an error
response will return a Status Code in the range of 4XX - 5XX along with
additional information about why the request could not complete successfully.

There are two categories of errors:
[HTTP Status Codes](./http-status-codes/index.mdx) and
[Result Codes](./result-codes/index.mdx). Result Codes only follow a Transaction
Failed (400) HTTP Status Code.
